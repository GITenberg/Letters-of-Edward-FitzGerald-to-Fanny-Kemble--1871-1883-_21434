1</span>LETTERS OF EDWARD FITZGERALD TO FANNY KEMBLE<br />
1871-1883</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Letters . . . such as are written from wise men, are, 
of all the words of man, in my judgment the 
best.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bacon</span>.</p>
<p>The following letters, addressed by Edward FitzGerald to his 
life-long friend Fanny Kemble, form an almost continuous series, 
from the middle of 1871 to within three weeks of his death in 
1883.&nbsp; They are printed as nearly as possible as he wrote 
them, preserving his peculiarities of punctuation and his use of 
capital letters, although in this he is not always 
consistent.&nbsp; In writing to me in 1873 he said, &lsquo;I love
the old Capitals for Nouns.&rsquo;&nbsp; It has been a task of 
some difficulty to arrange the letters in their proper order, in 
consequence of many of them being either not dated at all or only
imperfectly dated; but I hope I have succeeded in giving them, 
approximately at <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>least, in their true sequence.&nbsp; 
The notes which are added are mainly for the purpose of 
explaining allusions, and among them will be found extracts from 
other letters in my possession which have not been 
published.&nbsp; The references to the printed 
&lsquo;Letters&rsquo; are to the separate edition in the Eversley
Series, 2 vols. (Macmillans, 1894).</p>
<p>In a letter to Mr. Arthur Malkin, October 15, 1854 
(&lsquo;Further Records,&rsquo; ii. 193), Mrs. Kemble enunciates 
her laws of correspondence, to which frequent reference is made 
in the present series as the laws of the Medes and Persians: 
&lsquo;You bid me not answer your letter, but I have certain 
<i>organic laws</i> of correspondence from which nothing short of
a miracle causes me to depart; as, for instance, I never write 
till I am written to, I always write when I am written to, and I 
make a point of always returning the same amount of paper I 
receive, as you may convince yourself by observing that I send 
you two sheets of note-paper and Mary Anne only half one, though 
I have nothing more to say to you, and I have to her.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>July</i> 4, [1871.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I asked Donne to tell you, if he found opportunity, that some 
two months ago I wrote you a letter, but found it so empty and 
dull that I would not send it to extort the Reply which you feel 
bound to give.&nbsp; I should have written to tell you so myself;
but I heard from Donne of the Wedding soon about to be, and I 
would not intrude then.&nbsp; Now that is over <a 
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a" 
class="citation">[3a]</a>&mdash;I hope to the satisfaction of you
all&mdash;and I will say my little say, and you will have to 
Reply, according to your own Law of Mede and Persian.</p>
<p>It is a shame that one should only have oneself to talk about;
and yet that is all I have; so it shall be short.&nbsp; If you 
will but tell me of yourself, who have read, and seen, and done, 
so much more, you will find much more matter for your pen, and 
also for my entertainment.</p>
<p>Well, I have sold my dear little Ship, <a 
name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b" 
class="citation">[3b]</a> because I could not employ my Eyes with
reading in her Cabin, where I had nothing else to do.&nbsp; I 
think those Eyes <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>began to get better directly I had 
written to agree to the Man&rsquo;s proposal.&nbsp; Anyhow, the 
thing is done; and so now I betake myself to a Boat, whether on 
this River here, or on the Sea at the Mouth of it.</p>
<p>Books you see I have nothing to say about.&nbsp; The Boy who 
came to read to me made such blundering Work that I was forced to
confine him to a Newspaper, where his Blunders were often as 
entertaining as the Text which he mistook.&nbsp; We had 
&lsquo;hangarues&rsquo; in the French Assembly, and, on one 
occasion, &lsquo;ironclad Laughter from the Extreme 
Left.&rsquo;&nbsp; Once again, at the conclusion of the London 
news, &lsquo;Consolations closed at 91, ex Div.&rsquo;&mdash;And 
so on.&nbsp; You know how illiterate People will jump at a Word 
they don&rsquo;t know, and twist it in[to] some word they are 
familiar with.&nbsp; I was telling some of these Blunders to a 
very quiet Clergyman here some while ago, and he assured me that 
a poor Woman, reading the Bible to his Mother, read off glibly, 
&lsquo;Stand at a Gate and swallow a Candle.&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
believe this was no Joke of his: whether it were or not, here you
have it for what you may think it worth.</p>
<p>I should be glad to hear that you think Donne looking and 
seeming well.&nbsp; Archdeacon Groome, who saw him lately, 
thought he looked very jaded: which I could not wonder at.&nbsp; 
Donne, however, writes as if in good Spirits&mdash;brave Man as 
he is&mdash;and I hope you will be able to tell me that he is not
so much amiss.&nbsp; He said that he was to be at the 
Wedding.</p>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
5</span>You will tell me too how long you remain in England; I 
fancy, till Winter: and then you will go to Rome again, with its 
new Dynasty installed in it.&nbsp; I fancy I should not like that
so well as the old; but I suppose it&rsquo;s better for the 
Country.</p>
<p>I see my Namesake (Percy) Fitzgerald advertizes a Book about 
the Kembles.&nbsp; That I shall manage to get sight of.&nbsp; He 
made far too long work of Garrick.&nbsp; I should have thought 
the Booksellers did not find that pay, judging by the price to 
which Garrick soon came down.&nbsp; Half of it would have been 
enough.</p>
<p>Now I am going for a Sail on the famous River Deben, to pass 
by the same fields of green Wheat, Barley, Rye, and Beet-root, 
and come back to the same Dinner.&nbsp; Positively the only new 
thing we have in Woodbridge is a Waxen Bust (Lady, of course) at 
the little Hairdresser&rsquo;s opposite.&nbsp; She turns slowly 
round, to our wonder and delight; and I caught the little Barber 
the other day in the very Act of winding her up to run her daily 
Stage of Duty.&nbsp; Well; she has not got to answer Letters, as 
poor Mrs. Kemble must do to hers always sincerely</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>.&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Nov</span><sup>r</sup>. 2/71.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Is it better not to write at all than only write to plead that
one has nothing to say?&nbsp; Yet I <!-- page 6--><a 
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>don&rsquo;t 
like to let the year get so close to an end without reminding you
of me, to whom you have been always so good in the matter of 
replying to my letters, as in other ways.</p>
<p>If I can tell you nothing of myself: no Books read because of 
no Eyes to read them: no travel from home because of my little 
Ship being vanished: no friends seen, except Donne, who came here
with Valentia for two days&mdash;<i>you</i> can fill a sheet like
this, I know, with some account of yourself and your Doings: and 
I shall be very glad to hear that all is well with you.&nbsp; 
Donne said he believed you were in Ireland when he was here; and 
he spoke of your being very well when he had last seen you; also 
telling me he thought you were to stay in England this 
winter.&nbsp; By the by, I also heard of Mrs. Wister being at 
Cambridge; not Donne told me this, but Mr. Wright, the Bursar of 
Trinity: and every one who speaks of her says she is a very 
delightful Lady.&nbsp; Donne himself seemed very well, and in 
very good Spirits, in spite of all his domestic troubles.&nbsp; 
What Courage, and Good Temper, and Self-sacrifice!&nbsp; Valentia
(whom I had not seen these dozen years) seemed a very sensible, 
unaffected Woman.</p>
<p>I would almost bet that you have not read my Namesake&rsquo;s 
Life of your Namesakes, which I must borrow another pair of Eyes 
for one day.&nbsp; My Boy-reader gave me a little taste of it 
from the Athen&aelig;um; as also of Mr. Harness&rsquo; Memoirs, 
<a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6" 
class="citation">[6]</a> which I must get at.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>This is a sorry sight <a name="citation7"></a><a 
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> of a Letter:&mdash;do 
not trouble yourself to write a better&mdash;that you must, in 
spite of yourself&mdash;but write to me a little about yourself; 
which is a matter of great Interest to yours always</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F.G.</p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Nov.</i> 1871.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I ought to be much obliged to you for answering my last letter
with an uneasy hand, as you did.&nbsp; So I do thank you: and 
really wish that you would not reply to this under any such pain:
but how do I know but that very pain will make you more 
determined to reply?&nbsp; I must only beg you not to do so: and 
thus wash <i>my</i> hands of any responsibilities in the 
matter.</p>
<p>And what will you say when I tell you that I can hardly pity 
one who suffers from Gout; though I would undoubtedly prefer that
you should be free from that, or any other ailment.&nbsp; But I 
have always heard that Gout exempts one from many other miseries 
which Flesh is heir to: at any rate, it almost always leaves the 
Head clear: and that is so much!&nbsp; My Mother, who suffered a 
good deal, used often to say how she was kept awake of nights by 
the Pain in her feet, or hands, but felt so clear aloft that she 
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>made Night pass even agreeably away with her reflections 
and recollections.</p>
<p>And you have your recollections and Reflections which you are 
gathering into Shape, you say, in a Memoir of your own 
Life.&nbsp; And you are good enough to say that you would read it
to me if I&mdash;were good enough to invite you to my House here 
some Summer Day!&nbsp; I doubt that Donne has given you too 
flattering an account of my house, and me: you know he is pleased
with every one and everything: I know it also, and therefore no 
longer dissuade him from spending his time and money in a flying 
Visit here in the course of his Visits to other East Anglian 
friends and Kinsmen.&nbsp; But I feel a little all the while as 
if I were taking all, and giving nothing in return: I mean, about
Books, People, etc., with which a dozen years discontinuance of 
Society, and, latterly, incompetent Eyes, have left me in the 
lurch.&nbsp; If you indeed will come and read your Memoir to me, 
I shall be entitled to be a Listener only: and you shall have my 
Ch&acirc;teau all to yourself for as long as you please: only do 
not expect me to be quite what Donne may represent.</p>
<p>It is disgusting to talk so much about oneself: but I really 
think it is better to say so much on this occasion.&nbsp; If you 
consider my circumstances, you will perhaps see that I am not 
talking unreasonably: I am sure, not with sham humility: and that
I am yours always and sincerely</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E.&nbsp; F.G.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>P.S.&nbsp; I should not myself have written so soon 
again, but to apprise you of a brace of Pheasants I have sent 
you.&nbsp; Pray do not write expressly to acknowledge 
them:&mdash;only tell me if they don&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; I know 
you thank me. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9" 
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<h2><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>IV.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">[27 <i>Feb.</i>, 1872.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Had I anything pleasant to write to you, or better Eyes to 
write it with, you would have heard from me before this.&nbsp; An
old Story, by way of Apology&mdash;to one who wants no such 
Apology, too.&nbsp; Therefore, true though it be there is enough 
of it.</p>
<p>I hear from Mowbray Donne that you were at his Father&rsquo;s 
Lectures, <a name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a" 
class="citation">[10a]</a> and looking yourself.&nbsp; So that is
all right.&nbsp; Are your Daughters&mdash;or one of 
them&mdash;still with you?&nbsp; I do not think you have been to 
see the Thanksgiving Procession, <a name="citation10b"></a><a 
href="#footnote10b" class="citation">[10b]</a> for which our 
Bells are even now ringing&mdash;the old Peal which I have known 
these&mdash;sixty years almost&mdash;though at that time it 
reached my Eyes (<i>sic</i>) through a Nursery window about two 
miles off.&nbsp; From that window I remember seeing my Father 
with another Squire <a name="citation10c"></a><a 
href="#footnote10c" class="citation">[10c]</a> passing over the 
Lawn with their little pack of Harriers&mdash;an almost 
obliterated Slide of the old <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Magic 
Lantern.&nbsp; My Mother used to come up sometimes, and we 
Children were not much comforted.&nbsp; She was a remarkable 
woman, as you said in a former letter: and as I constantly 
believe in outward Beauty as an Index of a Beautiful Soul within,
I used sometimes to wonder what feature in her fine face betrayed
what was not so good in her Character.&nbsp; I think (as usual) 
the Lips: there was a twist of Mischief about them now and then, 
like that in&mdash;the Tail of a Cat!&mdash;otherwise so smooth 
and amiable.&nbsp; I think she admired your Mother as much as any
one she knew, or had known.</p>
<p>And (I see by the Athen&aelig;um) Mr. Chorley is dead, <a 
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11" 
class="citation">[11]</a> whom I used to see at your 
Father&rsquo;s and Sister&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; Born in 1808 they
say: so, one year older than yours truly E. F.G.&mdash;who, 
however, is going to live through another page of 
Letter-paper.&nbsp; I think he was a capital Musical Critic, 
though he condemned Piccolomini, who was the last Singer I heard 
of Genius, Passion, and a Voice that told both.&nbsp; I am told 
she was no Singer: but that went some way to make amends.&nbsp; 
Chorley, too, though an irritable, nervous creature, as his 
outside expressed, was kind and affectionate to Family and 
Friend, I always heard.&nbsp; But I think the Angels must take 
care to keep in tune when he gets among them.</p>
<p>This is a wretched piece of Letter to extort the Answer which 
you feel bound to give.&nbsp; But I somehow wished to write: and 
not to write about myself; <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and so have 
only left room to say&mdash;to repeat&mdash;that I am yours ever 
sincerely</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F.G.</p>
<h2>V.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">[1872.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I set off with a Letter to you, though I do not very well know
how I am to go on with it.&nbsp; But my Reader has been so 
disturbed by a Mouse in the room that I have dismissed 
him&mdash;9&frac12; p.m.&mdash;and he has been reading (so far as
he could get on) Hawthorne&rsquo;s Notes of Italian Travel: which
interest me very much indeed, as being the Notes of a Man of 
Genius who will think for himself independently of Murray 
&amp;c.&nbsp; And then his Account of Rome has made me think of 
you more than once.&nbsp; We have indeed left off to-night at 
Radicofani: but, as my Boy is frightened away by the Mouse, I 
fancy I will write to you before I take my one Pipe&mdash;which 
were better left alone, considering that it gives but half an 
hour&rsquo;s rather pleasant musing at the expense of a troubled 
night.&nbsp; Is it not more foolish then to persist in doing this
than being frightened at a Mouse?&nbsp; This is not a mere fancy 
of the Boy&mdash;who is not a Fool, nor a &lsquo;Betty,&rsquo; 
and is seventeen years old: he inherits his terror from his 
Mother, he says: positively he has been in a cold Sweat because 
of this poor little thing in the room: and yet he is the son of a
Butcher <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>here.&nbsp; So I sent him home, and 
write to you instead of hearing him read Hawthorne.&nbsp; He is 
to bring some poisoned Wheat for the Mouse to-morrow.</p>
<p>Another Book he read me also made me think of you: Harness: 
whom I remember to have seen once or twice at your Father&rsquo;s
years ago.&nbsp; The Memoir of him (which is a poor thing) still 
makes one like&mdash;nay, love&mdash;him&mdash;as a kindly, 
intelligent, man.&nbsp; I think his latter letters very pleasant 
indeed.</p>
<p>I do not know if you are in London or in your 
&lsquo;Villeggiatura&rsquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a 
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a> in Kent.&nbsp; 
Donne must decide that for me.&nbsp; Even my Garden and Fields 
and Shrubs are more flourishing than I have yet seen them at this
time of Year: and with you all is in fuller bloom, whether you be
in Kent or Middlesex.&nbsp; Are you going on with your 
Memoir?&nbsp; Pray read Hawthorne.&nbsp; I dare say you do not 
quite forget Shakespeare now and then: dear old Harness, reading 
him to the last!</p>
<p>Pray do you read Annie Thackeray&rsquo;s new Story <a 
name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b" 
class="citation">[13b]</a> in Cornhill?&nbsp; She wrote me that 
she had taken great pains with it, and so thought it might not be
so good as what she took less pains with.&nbsp; I doated on her 
Village on the Cliff, but did not care for what I had read of 
hers since: and this new Story I have not seen!&nbsp; And pray do
you doat on George Eliot?</p>
<p>Here are a few questions suggested for you to answer&mdash;as 
answer I know you will.&nbsp; It is almost a <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Shame to put 
you to it by such a piece of inanity as this letter.&nbsp; But it
is written: it is 10 p.m.&nbsp; A Pipe&mdash;and then to 
Bed&mdash;with what Appetite for Sleep one may.</p>
<p>And I am yours sincerely always</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F.G.</p>
<h2>VI.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>: <i>June</i> 6, [1872].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Some little while ago I saw in a London Book Catalogue 
&lsquo;Smiles and Tears&mdash;a Comedy by Mrs. C. 
Kemble&rsquo;&mdash;I had a curiosity to see this: and so bought 
it.&nbsp; Do you know it?&mdash;Would you like to have it?&nbsp; 
It seems to be ingeniously contrived, and of easy and natural 
Dialogue: of the half sentimental kind of Comedy, as Comedies 
then were (1815) with a serious&mdash;very serious&mdash;element 
in it&mdash;taken from your Mother&rsquo;s Friend&rsquo;s, Mrs. 
Opie&rsquo;s (what a sentence!) story of &lsquo;Father and 
Daughter&rsquo;&mdash;the seduced Daughter, who finds her 
distracted Father writing her name on a Coffin he has drawn on 
the Wall of his Cell&mdash;All ends happily in the Play, however,
whatever may be the upshot of the Novel.&nbsp; But an odd thing 
is, that this poor Girl&rsquo;s name is &lsquo;Fitz 
Harding&rsquo;&mdash;and the Character was played by Miss Foote: 
whether before, or after, her seduction by Colonel Berkeley I 
know not.&nbsp; The Father was played by Young.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>Sir Frederick Pollock has been to see me here for two 
days, <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15" 
class="citation">[15]</a> and put me up to much that was going on
in the civilized World.&nbsp; He was very agreeable indeed: and I
believe his Visit did him good.&nbsp; What are you going to do 
with your Summer?&nbsp; Surely never came Summer with more 
Verdure: and I somehow think we shall have more rain to keep the 
Verdure up, than for the last few years we have had.</p>
<p>I am quite sure of the merit of George Eliot, and (I should 
have thought) of a kind that would suit me.&nbsp; But I have not 
as yet found an Appetite for her.&nbsp; I have begun taking the 
Cornhill that I may read Annie Thackeray&mdash;but I have not 
found Appetite for her as yet.&nbsp; Is it that one recoils from 
making so many new Acquaintances in Novels, and retreats upon 
one&rsquo;s Old Friends, in Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Sir

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I think I shall hear from you once again before you go 
abroad.&nbsp; To Rome!&nbsp; My Brother Peter <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>also is going
to winter there: but you would not have much in common with him, 
I think, so I say nothing of an Acquaintance between you.</p>
<p>I have been having Frederick Tennyson with me down here. <a 
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a" 
class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; He has come to England (from 
Jersey where his home now is) partly on Business, and partly to 
bring over a deaf old Gentleman who has discovered the Original 
Mystery of Free-masonry, by means of Spiritualism.&nbsp; The 
Freemasons have for Ages been ignorant, it seems, of the very 
Secret which all their Emblems and Signs refer to: and the 
question is, if they care enough for their own Mystery to buy it 
of this ancient Gentleman.&nbsp; If they do not, he will shame 
them by Publishing it to all the world.&nbsp; Frederick Tennyson,
who has long been a Swedenborgian, a Spiritualist, and is now 
even himself a Medium, is quite grand and sincere in this as in 
all else: with the Faith of a Gigantic Child&mdash;pathetic and 
yet humorous to consider and consort with.</p>
<p>I went to Sydenham for two days to visit the Brother I began 
telling you of: and, at a hasty visit to the Royal Academy, 
caught a glimpse of Annie Thackeray: <a name="citation16b"></a><a
href="#footnote16b" class="citation">[16b]</a> who had first 
caught a glimpse of me, and ran away from her Party to seize the 
hands of her Father&rsquo;s old friend.&nbsp; I did not know her 
at first: was half overset by her cordial welcome when she told 
me who she was; and made a blundering business of it 
altogether.&nbsp; So much so, that I could not but <!-- page 
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>write
afterwards to apologize to her: and she returned as kind an 
Answer as she had given a Greeting: telling me that my chance 
Apparition had been to her as &lsquo;A message from 
Papa.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was really something to have been of so 
much importance.</p>
<p>I keep intending to go out somewhere&mdash;if for no other 
reason than that my rooms here may be cleaned! which they will 
have it should be done once a year.&nbsp; Perhaps I may have to 
go to my old Field of Naseby, where Carlyle wants me to erect a 
Stone over the spot where I dug up some remains of those who were
slain there over two hundred years ago, for the purpose of 
satisfying him in his Cromwell History.&nbsp; This has been a 
fixed purpose of his these twenty years: I thought it had dropped
from his head: but it cropped up again this Spring, and I do not 
like to neglect such wishes.&nbsp; Ever yours</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>One last word about what you call my 
&lsquo;Half-invitation&rsquo; to Woodbridge.&nbsp; In one sense 
it is so; but not in the sense you imagine.</p>
<p>I never do invite any of my oldest Friends to come and see me,
am almost distressed at their proposing to do so.&nbsp; If they 
take me in their way to, or from, elsewhere (as Donne in his 
Norfolk Circuit) it is another matter.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>But I have built a pleasant house just outside the Town,
where I never live myself, but keep it mainly for some Nieces who
come there for two or three months in the Summer: and, when they 
are not there, for any Friends who like to come, for the Benefit 
of fresh Air and Verdure, <i>plus</i> the company of their 
Host.&nbsp; An Artist and his Wife have stayed there for some 
weeks for the last two years; and Donne and Valentia were to have
come, but that they went abroad instead.</p>
<p>And so, while I should even deprecate a Lady like you coming 
thus far only for my sake, who ought rather to go and ask 
Admission at your Door, I should be glad if you liked to come to 
my house for the double purpose aforesaid.</p>
<p>My Nieces have hitherto come to me from July to September or 
October.&nbsp; Since I wrote to you, they have proposed to come 
on May 21; though it may be somewhat later, as suits the health 
of the Invalid&mdash;who lives on small means with her elder 
Sister, who is her Guardian Angel.&nbsp; I am sure that no friend
of mine&mdash;and least of all you&mdash;would dissent from my 
making them my first consideration.&nbsp; I never ask them in 
Winter, when I think they are better in a Town: which Town has, 
since their Father&rsquo;s Death, been Lowestoft, where I see 
them from time to time.&nbsp; Their other six sisters (one only 
married) live elsewhere: all loving one another, 
notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Well: I have told you all I meant by my 
&lsquo;Half-Invitation.&rsquo;&nbsp; These N.E. winds are less 
inviting than <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span

<p>P.S.&mdash;You tell me that, once returned to America, you

been entrusted to another American Gentleman named Burne 
Jones&mdash;who kept it in a Desk ten years, and at last 
forwarded it as aforesaid&mdash;to me!&nbsp; The Note (of 
Ruskin&rsquo;s) is about one of the Persian Translations: almost

<p style="text-align: right">[1873.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>It is scarce fair to assail you on your return to England with
another Letter so close on that to which you have only just 
answered&mdash;you who <i>will</i> answer!&nbsp; I wish you would
consider this Letter of mine an Answer (as it really is) to that 
last of yours; and before long I will write again and call on you
then for a Reply.</p>
<p>What inspires me now is, that, about the time you were writing
to me about Burns and B&eacute;ranger, I was thinking of them 
&lsquo;which was the Greater Genius?&rsquo;&mdash;I can&rsquo;t 
say; but, with all my Admiration for about a Score of the 
Frenchman&rsquo;s almost perfect Songs, I would give all of them 
up for a Score of Burns&rsquo; Couplets, Stanzas, or single Lines
scattered among those quite <i>im</i>perfect Lyrics of his.&nbsp;
B&eacute;ranger, no doubt, was The <i>Artist</i>; which still is 
not the highest Genius&mdash;witness Shakespeare, Dante, 
&AElig;schylus, Calderon, to the contrary.&nbsp; Burns assuredly 
had more <i>Passion</i> than the Frenchman; which is not Genius 
either, but a great Part of the Lyric Poet still.&nbsp; What 
B&eacute;ranger might have been, if born and bred among Banks, 
Braes, and Mountains, I cannot tell: Burns had that advantage 
over him.&nbsp; And then the Highland Mary to love, amid the 
heather, as compared to Lise the Grisette in a Parisian 
Suburb!&nbsp; Some of the <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>old French 
Virelays and <i>Vaux-de-vire</i> come much nearer the Wild Notes 
of Burns, and go to one&rsquo;s heart like his; B&eacute;ranger 
never gets so far as that, I think.&nbsp; One knows he will come 
round to his pretty <i>refrain</i> with perfect grace; if he were
more Inspired he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My Love is like the red, red, Rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s newly sprung in June,<br />
My Love is like the Melody<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s sweetly play&rsquo;d in 
tune.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and he will love his Love,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Till a&rsquo; the Seas gang Dry&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes&mdash;Till a&rsquo; the Seas gang dry, my Dear.&nbsp; And 
then comes some weaker stuff about Rocks melting in the 
Sun.&nbsp; All Imperfect; but that red, red Rose has burned 
itself into one&rsquo;s silly Soul in spite of all.&nbsp; Do you 
know that one of Burns&rsquo; few almost perfect stanzas was 
perfect till he added two Syllables to each alternate Line to fit
it to the lovely Music which almost excuses such a dilution of 
the Verse?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ye Banks and Braes o&rsquo; bonnie Doon,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How can ye bloom (so fresh) so fair?<br />
Ye little Birds how can ye sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I so (weary) full of care!<br />
Thou&rsquo;lt break my heart, thou little Bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sings (singest so) upon the Thorn:<br />
Thou minds me of departed days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That never shall return<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Departed never to) return.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>Now I shall tell you two things which my last Quotation 
has recalled to me.</p>
<p>Some thirty years ago A. Tennyson went over Burns&rsquo; 
Ground in Dumfries.&nbsp; When he was one day by 
Doon-side&mdash;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell how it was, Fitz, but I
fell into a Passion of Tears&rsquo;&mdash;And A. T. not given to 
the melting mood at all.</p>
<p>No. 2.&nbsp; My friend old Childs of the romantic town of 
Bungay (if you can believe in it!) told me that one day he 
started outside the Coach in company with a poor Woman who had 
just lost Husband or Child.&nbsp; She talked of her Loss and 
Sorrow with some Resignation; till the Coach happened to pull up 
by a roadside Inn.&nbsp; A &lsquo;little Bird&rsquo; was singing 
somewhere; the poor Woman then broke into Tears, and 
said&mdash;&lsquo;I could bear anything but that.&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
dare say she had never even heard of Burns: but he had heard the 
little Bird that he knew would go to all Hearts in Sorrow.</p>
<p>B&eacute;ranger&rsquo;s Morals are Virtue as compared to what 
have followed him in France.&nbsp; Yet I am afraid he partly led 
the way.&nbsp; Burns&rsquo; very <i>Passion</i> half excused him;
so far from its being Refinement which Burke thought deprived 
Vice of half its Mischief!</p>
<p>Here is a Sermon for you, you see, which you did not compound 
for: nor I neither when I began my Letter.&nbsp; But I think I 
have told you the two Stories aforesaid which will almost deprive
my sermon of half its Dulness.&nbsp; And I am now going to 
transcribe <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>you a <i>Vau-de-vire</i> of old 
Olivier de Basselin, <a name="citation23a"></a><a 
href="#footnote23a" class="citation">[23a]</a> which will show 
you something of that which I miss in B&eacute;ranger.&nbsp; But 
I think I had better write it on a separate Paper.&nbsp; Till 
which, what think you of these lines of Cl&eacute;ment Marot on 
the Death of some French Princess who desired to be buried among 
the Poor? <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b" 
class="citation">[23b]</a></p>
<p>[P.S.&mdash;These also must go on the Fly-leaf: being too 
long, Alexandrine, for these Pages.]</p>
<p>What a Letter!&nbsp; But if you are still at your Vicarage, 
you can read it in the Intervals of Church.&nbsp; I was surprised
at your coming so early from Italy: the famous Holy Week there is
now, I suppose, somewhat shorn of its Glory.&mdash;If you were 
not so sincere I should think you were persiflaging me about the 
Photo, as applied to myself, and yourself.&nbsp; Some years ago I
said&mdash;and now say&mdash;I wanted one of you; <!-- page 
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and 
if this letter were not so long, would tell you a little how to 
sit.&nbsp; Which you would not attend to; but I should be all the
same, your long-winded</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>May</i> 1, [1873.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I am very glad that you will be Photographed: though not by 
the Ipswich Man who did me, there are no doubt many much better 
in London.</p>
<p>Of course the whole Figure is best, if it can be artistically 
arranged.&nbsp; But certainly the safe plan is to venture as 
little as possible when an Artist&rsquo;s hand cannot harmonize 
the Lines and the Lights, as in a Picture.&nbsp; And as the Face 
is the Chief Object, I say the safest thing is to sit for the 
Face, neck, and Shoulders only.&nbsp; By this, one not only 
avoids any conflict about Arms and Hands (which generally disturb
the Photo), but also the Lines and Lights of Chair, Table, 
etc.</p>
<p>For the same reason, I vote for nothing but a plain 
Background, like a Curtain, or sober-coloured Wall.</p>
<p>I think also that there should be no White in the Dress, which
is apt to be too positive for the Face.&nbsp; Nothing nearer 
White than such material as (I think) Brussels Lace (?) of a 
yellowish or even dirty hue; of which there may be a Fringe 
between Dress and <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Skin.&nbsp; I have advised Men 
Friends to sit in a&mdash;dirty Shirt!</p>
<p>I think a three-quarter face is better that a Full; for one 
reason, that I think the Sitter feels more at ease looking 
somewhat away, rather than direct at the luminous Machine.&nbsp; 
This will suit you, who have a finely turned Head, which is 
finely placed on Neck and Shoulders.&nbsp; But, as your Eyes are 
fine also, don&rsquo;t let them be turned too much aside, nor at 
all downcast: but simply looking as to a Door or Window a little 
on one side.</p>
<p>Lastly (!) I advise sitting in a lightly clouded Day; not in a
bright Sunlight at all.</p>
<p>You will think that I am preaching my own Photo to you.&nbsp; 
And it is true that, though I did not sit with any one of these 
rules in my head; but just as I got out of a Cab, etc., yet the 
success of the Thing made me consider afterward why it succeeded;
and I have now read you my Lecture on the Subject.&nbsp; Pray do 
not forgo your Intention&mdash;nay, your Promise, as I regard 
it&mdash;to sit, and send me the result. <a

<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>Here has been a bevy of Letters, and long ones, from me,
you see.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if it is reasonable that one 
should feel it so much easier to write to a Friend in England 
than to the same Friend abroad; but so it is, with me at 
least.&nbsp; I suppose that a Letter directed to Stoneleigh will 
find you before you leave&mdash;for America!&mdash;and even after
that.&nbsp; But I shall not feel the same confidence and ease in 
transcribing for you pretty Norman Songs, or gossiping about them
as I have done when my Letters were only to travel to Kenilworth:
which very place&mdash;which very name of a Place&mdash;makes the
English world akin.&nbsp; I suppose you have been at Stratford 
before this&mdash;an event in one&rsquo;s Life.&nbsp; It was not 
the Town itself&mdash;or even the <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>Church&mdash;that touched me most: but the old Footpaths
over the Fields which He must have crossed three Centuries 
ago.</p>
<p>Spedding tells me he is nearing Land with his Bacon.&nbsp; And
one begins to think Macready a Great Man amid the Dwarfs that now
occupy his Place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I have not forgotten you at all, all these months&mdash;What a
Consolation to you!&nbsp; But I felt I had nothing to send among 
the Alps after you: I have been nowhere but for two Days to the 
Field of Naseby in Northamptonshire, where I went to identify the
spot where I dug up the Dead for Carlyle thirty years ago.&nbsp; 
I went; saw; made sure; and now&mdash;the Trustees of the Estate 
won&rsquo;t let us put up the Memorial stone we proposed to put 
up; they approve (we hear) neither of the Stone, nor the 
Inscription; both as plain and innocent as a Milestone, says 
Carlyle, and indeed much of the same Nature.&nbsp; This Decision 
of the foolish Trustees I only had some ten days ago: posted it 
to Carlyle who answered from Dumfries; and his Answer shows that 
he is in full vigour, though (as ever since I have known him) he 
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>protests that Travelling has utterly discomfited him, 
and he will move no more.&nbsp; But it is very silly of these 
Trustees. <a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a" 
class="citation">[28a]</a></p>
<p>And, as I have been nowhere, I have seen no one; nor read 
anything but the Tichborne Trial, and some of my old 
Books&mdash;among them Walpole, Wesley, and Johnson (Boswell, I 
mean), three very different men whose Lives extend over the same 
times, and whose diverse ways of looking at the world they lived 
in make a curious study.&nbsp; I wish some one would write a good
Paper on this subject; I don&rsquo;t mean to hint that I am the 
man; on the contrary, I couldn&rsquo;t at all; but I could supply
some [one] else with some material that he would not care to hunt
up in the Books perhaps.</p>
<p>Well: all this being all, I had no heart to write&mdash;to the
Alps!&nbsp; And now I remember well you told me you [were] coming
back to England&mdash;for a little while&mdash;a little 
while&mdash;and then to the New World for ever&mdash;which I 
don&rsquo;t believe! <a name="citation28b"></a><a 
href="#footnote28b" class="citation">[28b]</a>&nbsp; Oh no! you 
will come back in spite of yourself, depend upon it&mdash;and yet
I doubt that my saying so will be one little reason why you will 
not!&nbsp; But do let me hear of you first: and believe me ever 
yours</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>You must attribute this third Letter to an 
&lsquo;<i>Id&eacute;e</i>&rsquo; that has come into my head 
relating to those Memoirs of yourself which you say you are at 
some loss to dispose of.&nbsp; I can easily understand that your 
Children, born and bred (I think) in another World, would not 
take so much interest in them as some of your old Friends who 
make part of your Recollections: as you yourself occupy much of 
theirs.&nbsp; But then they are <i>old</i> Friends; and are not 
their Children, Executors and Assigns, as little to be depended 
on as your own Kith and Kin?&nbsp; Well; I bethink me of one of 
your old Friends&rsquo; Children whom I could reckon upon for 
you, as I would for myself: Mowbray Donne: the Son of one who you
know loves you of old, and inheriting all his Father&rsquo;s 
Loyalty to his Father&rsquo;s Friends.&nbsp; I am quite convinced
that he is to be perfectly depended upon in all respects for this
purpose; for his Love, his Honour, and his Intelligence.&nbsp; I 
should then make him one day read the Memoirs to me&mdash;for I 
can&rsquo;t be assured of my own Eyes interpreting your MS. 
without so much difficulty as would disturb one&rsquo;s 
Enjoyment, or Appreciation, of such a Memoir.&nbsp; Unless indeed
you should one day come down yourself to my Ch&acirc;teau in dull
Woodbridge, and there read it over, and talk it over.</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
30</span>Well; this is what I seriously advise, always supposing 
that you have decided not to print and publish the Memoir during 
your Life.&nbsp; No doubt you could make money of it, beside 
&lsquo;bolting up&rsquo; <a name="citation30"></a><a 
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a> such Accident as the
Future comprehends.&nbsp; The latter would, I know, be the only 
recommendation to you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you will do at all as I advise you.&nbsp; 
But I nevertheless advise you as I should myself in case I had 
such a Record as you have to leave behind me.&mdash;</p>
<p>Now once more for French Songs.&nbsp; When I was in Paris in 
1830, just before that Revolution, I stopped one Evening on the 
Boulevards by the Madeleine to listen to a Man who was singing to
his Barrel-organ.&nbsp; Several passing &lsquo;Blouses&rsquo; had
stopped also: not only to listen, but to join in the Songs, 
having bought little &lsquo;<i>Libretti</i>&rsquo; of the words 
from the Musician.&nbsp; I bought one too; for, I suppose, the 
smallest French Coin; and assisted in the Song which the Man 
called out beforehand (as they do Hymns at Church), and of which 
I enclose you the poor little Copy.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Le Bon 
Pasteur</i>, s&rsquo;il vous plait&rsquo;&mdash;I suppose the 
Circumstances: the &lsquo;beau temps,&rsquo; the pleasant 
Boulevards, the then so amiable People, all contributed to the 
effect this Song had upon me; anyhow, it has constantly revisited
my memory for these forty-three years; and I was thinking, the 
other day, touched me more than any of B&eacute;ranger&rsquo;s 
most beautiful Things.&nbsp; This, however, <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>may be only 
one of &lsquo;Old Fitz&rsquo;s&rsquo; Crotchets, as Tennyson and 
others would call them. <a name="citation31"></a><a 
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>I have been trying again at another Great 
<i>Artist&rsquo;s</i> work which I never could care for at all, 
Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, in Hayward&rsquo;s Prose 
Translation; Eighth Edition.&nbsp; Hayward quotes from Goethe 
himself, that, though of course much of a Poem must evaporate in 
a Prose Translation, yet the Essence must remain.&nbsp; Well; I 
distinguish as little of that Essential Poetry in the Faust now 
as when I first read it&mdash;longer ago than &lsquo;<i>Le Bon 
Pasteur</i>,&rsquo; and in other subsequent Attempts.&nbsp; I was
tempted to think this was some Defect&mdash;great Defect&mdash;in
myself: but a Note at the end of the Volume informs me that a 
much greater Wit than I was in the same plight&mdash;even 
Coleridge; who admires the perfect German Diction, the Songs, 
Choruses, etc. (which are such parts as cannot be translated into
Prose); he also praises Margaret and Mephistopheles; but thinks 
Faust himself dull, and great part of the Drama flat and 
tiresome; and the whole Thing not a self-evolving Whole, but an 
unconnected Series of Scenes: all which are parts that can be 
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>judged of from Translation, by Goethe&rsquo;s own 
Authority.&nbsp; I find a great want of Invention and Imagination
both in the Events and Characters.</p>
<p>Gervinus&rsquo; Theory of Hamlet is very staking.&nbsp; 
Perhaps Shakespeare himself would have admitted, without ever 
having expressly designed, it.&nbsp; I always said with regard to
the Explanation of Hamlet&rsquo;s Madness or Sanity, that 
Shakespeare himself might not have known the Truth any more than 
we understand the seeming Discords we see in People we know 
best.&nbsp; Shakespeare intuitively imagined, and portrayed, the 
Man without being able to give a 
reason&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>&mdash;I believe in Genius doing this:
and remain your Inexhaustible Correspondent</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Had you but written your Dublin Address in full, I should have
caught you before you left.&nbsp; As you did not, I follow your 
Directions, and enclose to Coutts.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

very much prefer&mdash;by the two which I return: I am very much 
obliged to you indeed for taking all the Trouble; and the Photo I
have retained is very satisfactory to me in every respect: as I 
believe you will find it to be to such other Friends as you would
give a Copy to.&nbsp; I can fancy that this Photo is a fair one; 
I mean, a fair Likeness: one of the full Faces was nearly as good
to me, but for the darkness of the Lips&mdash;that common default
in these things&mdash;but the other dark Fullface is very unfair 
indeed.&nbsp; You must give Copies to dear old Donne, and to one 
or two others, and I should like to hear from you [before you]

<p>It was indeed so unlike your obstinate habit of 
Reply&mdash;this last exception&mdash;that I thought you must be 
ill; and I was really thinking of writing to Mr. Leigh to ask 
about you&mdash;I have been ailing myself with some form of 
Rheumatism&mdash;whether Lumbago, Sciatica, or what 
not&mdash;which has made my rising up and sitting down especially
uncomfortable; Country Doctor quite incompetent, etc.&nbsp; But 
the Heavenly Doctor, Ph&oelig;bus, seems more

<p>I had meant to send you the Air of the Bon Pasteur when I sent
the words: I never heard it but that once, but I find that the

class="citation">[34a]</a> which poor Haydon found of his poor 
Wife&rsquo;s writing in the midst of the Distress from which he 
extricated himself so suddenly.&nbsp; And I felt how these poor 
Verses touched me far more than any of 
B&eacute;ranger&rsquo;s&mdash;though scarcely more than many of 
Burns&rsquo;.&nbsp; I know that the Story which they involve 
appeals more to one&rsquo;s heart than the Frenchman does; but I 
am also sure that his perfect <i>Art</i> injures, and not 
assists, the utterance of Nature.&nbsp; I transcribe these poor 
Verses for you, as you may not have the Book at hand, and yet I 
think you will thank me for recalling them to you.&nbsp; I find 
them in a MS. Book I have which I call &lsquo;Half Hours with the
Worst Authors,&rsquo; <a name="citation34b"></a><a 
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a> and if People 
would believe that I know what is good for them in these matters,
the Book would make a very good one for the Public.&nbsp; But if 
People don&rsquo;t see as I do by themselves, they wouldn&rsquo;t
any the more for my telling them, not having any Name to bid 
their Attention.&nbsp; So my Bad Authors must be left to my Heirs

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I should have written to you before, but that I was waiting 
for some account, for better or worse, of our friend Donne; who 
has been seriously ill this Fortnight and more.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t know what his original Ailment was, unless a Cold; 
but the Effect has been to leave him so weak, that even now the 
Doctor fears for any Relapse which he might not be strong enough 
to bear.&nbsp; He had been for a Visit to friends in the West of 
England: and became ill directly he returned to London.&nbsp; You
may think it odd I don&rsquo;t know what was his Illness; but 
Mowbray, who has told me all I know, did not tell me that: and so
I did not ask, as I could do no good by knowing.&nbsp; Perhaps it
is simply a Decay, or Collapse, of Body, or Nerves&mdash;or even 
Mind:&mdash;a Catastrophe which I never thought unlikely with 
Donne, who has toiled and suffered so much, for others rather 
than for himself; and keeping all his Suffering to himself.&nbsp;
He wrote <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>me a letter about himself a week ago;
cheerful, and telling me of Books he read: so as no one would 
guess he was so ill; but a Letter from Mowbray by the same Post 
told me he was still in a precarious Condition.&nbsp; I had 
wished to tell you that he was better, if not well: but I may 
wait some time for that: and so I will write now:&mdash;with the 
Promise that I will write again directly there is anything else 
to tell.</p>
<p>Here my Reader comes to give me an Instalment of Tichborne: so
I shall shut up, perhaps till To-morrow.</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice and Co. have just decided to adjourn 
the Trial for ten Days, till Witnesses arrive from your side of 
the Atlantic.&nbsp; My Reader has just adjourned to some Cake and
Porter&mdash;I tell him not to hurry&mdash;while I go on with 
this Letter.&nbsp; To tell you that, I might almost have well 
adjourned writing &lsquo;sine die&rsquo; (can you construe?), for
I don&rsquo;t think I have more to tell you now.&nbsp; Only that 
I am reading&mdash;Crabbe!&nbsp; And I want you to tell me if he 
is read on that side of the Atlantic from which we are expecting 
Tichborne Witnesses.</p>
<p>(Reader finishes Cake and Porter: and we now adjourn to 
&lsquo;All the Year Round.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>10 p.m.&nbsp; &lsquo;All the Year Round&rsquo; read&mdash;part
of it&mdash;and Reader departed.</p>
<p>Pray do tell me if any one reads Crabbe in America; nobody 
does here, you know, but myself; who bore about it.&nbsp; Does 
Mrs. Wister, who reads many things?&nbsp; Does Mrs. Kemble, now 
she has the Atlantic between her and the old Country?</p>

<p>I think that last line will bring the Tears into Mrs. 
Kemble&rsquo;s Eyes&mdash;which I can&rsquo;t find in the 
Photograph she sent me.&nbsp; Yet they are not extinguisht, 
surely?</p>
<p>I read in some Athen&aelig;um that A. Tennyson was changing 
his Publisher again: and some one told me that it was in 
consequence of the resigning Publisher having lost money by his 
contract with the Poet; which was, to pay him &pound;1000 per 
Quarter for the exclusive sale of his Poems.&nbsp; It was a 
Woodbridge <i>Literati</i> who told me this, having read it in a 
Paper called &lsquo;The Publisher.&rsquo;&nbsp; More I know 
not.</p>
<p>A little more such stuff I might write: but I think here is 
enough of it.&nbsp; For this Night, anyhow: so I shall lick the 
Ink from my Pen; and smoke one Pipe, not forgetting you while I 
do so; and if nothing turns up To-morrow, here is my Letter done,

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>A Letter to be written to you from the room I have written to 
you before in: but my Letter must wait till I return to 
Woodbridge, where your Address is on record.&nbsp; I have thought
several times of writing to you since this Year began; but I have
been in a muddle&mdash;leaving my old Markethill Lodgings, and 
vacillating between my own rather lonely Ch&acirc;teau, and this 
Place, where some Nieces are.&nbsp; I had wished to tell you what
I know of our dear Donne: who Mowbray says gets on still.&nbsp; I
suppose he will never be so strong again.&nbsp; Laurence wrote me
that he had met him in the Streets, looking thinner (!) with (as 
it were) keener Eyes.&nbsp; That is a Portrait Painter&rsquo;s 
observation: probably a just one.&nbsp; Laurence has been 
painting for me a Copy of Pickersgill&rsquo;s Portrait of 
Crabbe&mdash;but I am afraid has made some muddle of it, 
according to his wont.&nbsp; I asked for a Sketch: he <!-- page 
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span><i>will</i> elaborate&mdash;and spoil.&nbsp; Instead of 
copying the Colours he sees and could simply match on his 
Palette, he <i>will</i> puzzle himself as to whether the Eyebrows
were once sandy, though now gray; and wants to compare 
Pickersgill&rsquo;s Portrait with Phillips&rsquo;&mdash;which I 
particularly wished to be left out of account.&nbsp; Laurence is 
a dear little fellow&mdash;a Gentleman&mdash;Spedding said, 
&lsquo;made of Nature&rsquo;s very finest Clay.&rsquo; <a 
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40" 
class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp; So he is: but the most obstinate 
little man&mdash;&lsquo;incorrigible,&rsquo; Richmond called him;
and so he wearies out those who wish most to serve and employ 
him; and so has spoiled his own Fortune.</p>
<p>Do you read in America of Holman Hunt&rsquo;s famous new 
Picture of &lsquo;The Shadow of Death,&rsquo; which he has been 
some seven Years painting&mdash;in Jerusalem, and now exhibits 
under theatrical Lights and accompaniments?&nbsp; This does not 
induce me to believe in H. Hunt more than heretofore: which 
is&mdash;not at all.&nbsp; Raffaelle, Mozart, Shakespeare, did 
not take all that time about a work, nor brought it forth to the 
world with so much Pomp and Circumstance.</p>
<p>Do you know Sainte Beuve&rsquo;s Causeries?&nbsp; I think one 
of the most delightful Books&mdash;a Volume of which I brought 
here, and makes me now write of it to you.&nbsp; It is a Book 
worth having&mdash;worth buying&mdash;for you can read it more 
than once, and twice.&nbsp; And I have <!-- page 41--><a 
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>taken up Don 
Quixote again: more Evergreen still; in Spanish, as it must be 
read, I doubt.</p>
<p>Here is a Sheet of Paper already filled, with matters very 
little worthy of sending over the Atlantic.&nbsp; But you will be
glad of the Donne news, at any rate.&nbsp; Do tell me ever so 
little of yourself in return.</p>
<p>Now my Eyes have had enough of this vile steel pen; and so 
have yours, I should think: and I will mix a Glass of poor Sherry
and Water, and fill a Pipe, and think of you while I smoke 
it.&nbsp; Think of me sometimes as</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>My Castle Clock has gone 9 p.m., and I myself am but half an 
hour home from a Day to Lowestoft.&nbsp; Why I should begin a 
Letter to you under these circumstances I scarce know.&nbsp; 
However, I have long been intending to write: nay, actually did 
write half a Letter which I mislaid.&nbsp; What I wanted to tell 
you was&mdash;and is&mdash;that Donne is going <!-- page 42--><a 
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>on very well:
Mowbray thinks he may be pronounced 
&lsquo;recovered.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may have heard about him from 
some other hand before this: I know you will be glad to hear it 
at any time, from any quarter.</p>
<p>This my Castle had been named by me &lsquo;Grange Farm,&rsquo;
being formerly a dependency of a more considerable Ch&acirc;teau 
on the hill above.&nbsp; But a fine tall Woman, who has been 
staying two days, ordered me to call it &lsquo;Little 
Grange.&rsquo;&nbsp; So it must be.&nbsp; She came to meet a 
little Niece of mine: both Annies: one tall as the other is 
short: both capital in Head and Heart: I knew they would 
<i>fadge</i> well: so they did: so we all did, waiting on 
ourselves and on one another.&nbsp; Odd that I have another 
tip-top Annie on my small list of Acquaintances&mdash;Annie 
Thackeray.</p>
<p>I wonder what Spring is like in America.&nbsp; We have had an 
April of really &lsquo;magnifique&rsquo; Weather: but here is 
that vixen May with its N.E. airs.&nbsp; A Nightingale however 
sings so close to my Bedroom that (the window being open) the 
Song is almost too loud.</p>
<p>I thought you would come back to Nightingale-land!</p>
<p>Donne is better: and Spedding has at last (I hear) got his 
load of Bacon off his Shoulders, after carrying it for near Forty
years!&nbsp; Forty years long!&nbsp; A fortnight ago there was 
such a delicious bit of his in Notes and Queries, <a 
name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42" 
class="citation">[42]</a> a Comment on some American Comment <!--
page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>on a passage in Antony and Cleopatra, that I recalled my
old Sorrow that he had not edited Shakespeare long ago instead of
wasting Life in washing his Blackamoor.&nbsp; Perhaps there is 
time for this yet: but is there the Will?</p>
<p>Pray, Madam, how do you emphasize the line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;After Life&rsquo;s fitful Fever he sleeps 
well,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which, by the by, one wonders never to have seen in some 
Churchyard?&nbsp; What do you think of this for an 
Epitaph&mdash;from Crabbe?&mdash;</p>

<p>Many a time have I written to you from this place: which may 
be the reason why I write again now&mdash;the very day your 
Letter reaches me&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t know that I have much 
to say, nor anything worth forcing from you the Answer that you 
will write.&nbsp; Let me look at your Letter again.&nbsp; Yes: so
I thought of &lsquo;<i>he</i> sleeps well,&rsquo; and yet I do 
not remember to have heard it so read.&nbsp; (I never heard you 
read the Play) I don&rsquo;t think Macready read it so.&nbsp; I 
liked his Macbeth, I must say: only he would say &lsquo;Amen 
st-u-u-u-ck in his throat,&rsquo; which was not only a blunder, 
but a vulgar blunder, I think.</p>
<p>Spedding&mdash;I should think indeed it was too late for him 
to edit Shakespeare, if he had not gone on doing so, as it were, 
all his Life.&nbsp; Perhaps it is too late for him to remember 
half, or a quarter, of his own Observations.&nbsp; Well then: I 
wish he would record what he does remember: if not an Edition of 
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

am persuaded that no one is more competent. <a

<p>You see your Americans will go too far.&nbsp; It was some

told that, every Cold I catch, my Skeleton is to come out, 
etc.&nbsp; Every N.E. wind that blows, etc.&nbsp; I had not been

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I must write to you&mdash;for I have seen Donne, and can tell 
you that he looks and seems much better than I had expected, 
though I had been told to <!-- page 48--><a 
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>expect well: 
he was upright, well coloured, animated; I should say (<i>sotto 
voce</i>) better than he seemed to me two years ago.&nbsp; And 
this in spite of the new Lord Chamberlain <a 
name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a" 
class="citation">[48a]</a> having ousted him from his Theatrical 
post, wanting a younger and more active man to go and see the 
Plays, as well as read them.&nbsp; I do not think this unjust; I 
was told by Pollock that the dismissal was rather abrupt: but 
Donne did not complain of it.&nbsp; When does he complain?&nbsp; 
He will now, however, leave Weymouth Street, and inhabit some 
less costly house&mdash;not wanting indeed so large [a] one for 
his present household.&nbsp; He is shortly going with his 
Daughters to join the Blakesleys at Whitby.&nbsp; Mowbray was 
going off for his Holiday to Cornwall: I just heard him speaking 
of Freddy&rsquo;s present Address to his father: Blanche was much
stronger, from the treatment of a Dr. Beard <a 
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b" 
class="citation">[48b]</a> (I think).&nbsp; I was quite moved by 
her warm salutation when I met her, after some fifteen 
years&rsquo; absence.&nbsp; All this I report from a Visit I made
to Donne&rsquo;s own house in London.&nbsp; A thing I scarce ever
thought to do again, you may know: but I could not bear to be 
close to him in London for two days without assuring myself with 
my own Eyes how he looked.&nbsp; I think I observed a slight 
hesitation of memory: but certainly not so much as I find in 
myself, nor, I suppose, unusual in one&rsquo;s 
Contemporaries.&nbsp; My visit to London <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>followed a 
visit to Edinburgh: which I have intended these thirty years, 
only for the purpose of seeing my dear Sir Walter&rsquo;s House 
and Home: and which I am glad to have seen, as that of 
Shakespeare.&nbsp; I had expected to find a rather Cockney 
Castle: but no such thing: all substantially and proportionably 
built, according to the Style of the Country: the Grounds well 
and simply laid out: the woods he planted well-grown, and that 
dear Tweed running and murmuring still&mdash;as on the day of his
Death. <a name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a" 
class="citation">[49a]</a>&nbsp; I did not so much care for 
Melrose, and Jedburgh, <a name="citation49b"></a><a 
href="#footnote49b" class="citation">[49b]</a> though his Tomb is
there&mdash;in one of the half-ruined corners.&nbsp; Another day 
I went to Trossachs, Katrine, Lomond, etc., which (as I expected)
seemed much better to me in Pictures and Drop-scenes.&nbsp; I was
but three days in Scotland, and was glad to get back to my own 
dull flat country, though I did worship the Pentland, Cheviot, 
and Eildon, Hills, more for their Associations than 
themselves.&nbsp; They are not big enough for that.</p>
<p>I saw little in London: the Academy Pictures even below the 
average, I thought: only a Picture by Millais of an old Sea 
Captain <a name="citation49c"></a><a href="#footnote49c" 
class="citation">[49c]</a> being read to by <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>his Daughter 
which moistened my Eyes.&nbsp; I thought she was reading him the 
Bible, which he seemed half listening to, half rambling over his 
past Life: but I am told (I had no Catalogue) that she was 
reading about the North West Passage.&nbsp; There were three deep
of Bonnets before Miss Thompson&rsquo;s famous Roll Call of the

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Your letter reached me this morning: and you see I lose no 
time in telling you that, as I hear from Pollock, Donne is 
allowed &pound;350 a year retiring Pension.&nbsp; So I think 
neither he nor his friends have any reason to complain.&nbsp; His
successor in the office is named (I think) &lsquo;Piggott&rsquo; 
<a name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b" 
class="citation">[50b]</a>&mdash;Pollock thinks a good 
choice.&nbsp; Lord Hertford brought the old and the new Examiners
together to Dinner: and all went off well.&nbsp; Perhaps Donne 
himself may have told you all this before now.&nbsp; He was to 
be, about this time, with the Blakesleys at Whitby or 
Filey.&nbsp; I have not heard any of these particulars from 
himself: nothing indeed since I saw him in London.</p>
<p>Pollock was puzzled by an entry in Macready&rsquo;s <!-- page 
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>Journal&mdash;1831 or 1832&mdash;&lsquo;Received 
Thackeray&rsquo;s Tragedy&rsquo; with some such name as 
&lsquo;Retribution.&rsquo;&nbsp; I told Pollock I was sure it was
not W. M. T., who (especially at that time) had more turn to 
burlesque than real Tragedy: and sure that he would have told me 
of it then, whether accepted or rejected&mdash;as rejected it 
was.&nbsp; Pollock thought for some while that, in spite of the 
comic Appearance we keep up, we should each of us rise up from 
the Grave with a MS. Tragedy in our hands, etc.&nbsp; However, he
has become assured it was some other Thackeray: I suppose one 
mentioned by Planch&eacute; as a Dramatic 
<i>Dilettante</i>&mdash;of the same Family, I think, as W. M. 
T.</p>
<p>Spedding has sent me the concluding Volume of his Bacon: the 
final summing up simple, noble, deeply pathetic&mdash;rather on 
Spedding&rsquo;s own Account than his Hero&rsquo;s, for whose 
Vindication so little has been done by the sacrifice of forty 
years of such a Life as Spedding&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Positively, 
nearly all the new matter which S. has produced makes against, 
rather than for, Bacon: and I do think the case would have stood 
better if Spedding had only argued from the old materials, and 
summed up his Vindication in one small Volume some thirty-five 
years ago.</p>
<p>I have been sunning myself in Dickens&mdash;even in his later 
and very inferior &lsquo;Mutual Friend,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Great 
Expectations&rsquo;&mdash;Very inferior to his best: but with 
things better than any one else&rsquo;s best, caricature as they 
may be.&nbsp; I really must go and worship at Gadshill, as I have
worshipped at Abbotsford, though <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>with less 
Reverence, to be sure.&nbsp; But I must look on Dickens as a 
mighty Benefactor to Mankind. <a name="citation52"></a><a 
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a></p>
<p>This is shamefully bad writing of mine&mdash;very bad manners,
to put any one&mdash;especially a Lady&mdash;to the trouble and 
pain of deciphering.&nbsp; I hope all about Donne is legible, for
you will be glad of it.&nbsp; It is Lodging-house Pens and Ink 
that is partly to blame for this scrawl.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t 
answer till I write you something better: but believe me ever and
always yours</p>

class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>: <i>October</i> 4/74.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Do, pray, write your Macready (Thackeray used to say 
&lsquo;Megreedy&rsquo;) Story to Pollock: Sir F. 59 Montagu 
Square.&nbsp; I rather think he was to be going to Press with his
Megreedy about this time: but you may be sure he will deal with 
whatever you may confide to him discreetly and reverently.&nbsp; 
It is &lsquo;Miladi&rsquo; P. who worshipped Macready: and I 
think I never recovered what Esteem I had with her when I told 
her I could not look on him as a &lsquo;Great&rsquo; Actor at 
all.&nbsp; I see in Planch&eacute;&rsquo;s Memoirs that when your
Father prophesied great things of him to your Uncle J. P. K., the
latter said, &lsquo;<i>Con quello viso</i>?&rsquo; which 
&lsquo;<i>viso</i>&rsquo; did very well however in parts not 
positively heroic.&nbsp; But one can&rsquo;t think of <!-- page 
53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>him 
along with Kean, who was heroic in spite of undersize.&nbsp; How 
he swelled up in Othello!&nbsp; I remember thinking he looked 
almost as tall as your Father when he came to Silence that 
dreadful Bell.</p>
<p>I think you agree with me about Kean: remembering your really 
capital Paper&mdash;in <i>Macmillan</i> <a 
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a" 
class="citation">[53a]</a>&mdash;about Dramatic and 
Theatric.&nbsp; I often look to that Paper, which is bound up 
with some Essays by other Friends&mdash;Spedding among 
them&mdash;no bad Company.&nbsp; I was thinking of your Pasta 
story of &lsquo;feeling&rsquo; the Antique, etc., <a 
name="citation53b"></a><a href="#footnote53b" 
class="citation">[53b]</a> when reading in my dear Ste. Beuve <a 
name="citation53c"></a><a href="#footnote53c" 
class="citation">[53c]</a> of my dear Madame du Deffand asking 
Madame de Choiseul: &lsquo;You <i>know</i> you love me, but do 
you <i>feel</i> you love me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Quoi</i>? 
<i>vous m&rsquo;aimez donc</i>?&rsquo; she said to her secretary 
Wiart, when she heard him sobbing as she dictated her last letter
to Walpole. <a name="citation53d"></a><a href="#footnote53d" 
class="citation">[53d]</a></p>
<p>All which reminds me of one of your friends 
departed&mdash;Chorley&mdash;whose Memoirs one now buys from 
Mudie for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> or so.&nbsp; And 
well&mdash;<i>well</i>&mdash;worth to those who recollect 
him.&nbsp; I only knew him by Face&mdash;and Voice&mdash;at your 
Father&rsquo;s, and your <!-- page 54--><a 
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>Sister&rsquo;s: and used to think what a little waspish 
<i>Dilettante</i> it was: and now I see he was something very 
much better indeed: and I only hope I may have Courage to face my
Death as he had.&nbsp; Dickens loved him, who did not love 
Humbugs: and Chorley would have two strips of Gadshill Yew <a 
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54" 
class="citation">[54]</a> put with him in his Coffin.&nbsp; Which
again reminds me that&mdash;<i>&agrave; propos</i> of your 
comments on Dickens&rsquo; crimson waistcoat, etc., Thackeray 
told me thirty years ago, that Dickens did it, not from any idea 
of Cockney fashion: but from a veritable passion for 
Colours&mdash;which I can well sympathize with, though I should 
not exhibit them on my own Person&mdash;for very good 
reasons.&nbsp; Which again reminds me of what you write about my 
abiding the sight of you in case you return to England next 
year.&nbsp; Oh, my dear Mrs. Kemble, you must know how wrong all 
that is&mdash;<i>tout au contraire</i>, in fact.&nbsp; Tell me a 
word about Chorley when next you write: you said once that 
Mendelssohn laughed at him: then, he ought not.&nbsp; How well I 
remember his strumming away at some Waltz in Harley or 
Wimpole&rsquo;s endless Street, while your Sister and a few other
Guests went round.&nbsp; I thought then he looked at one as if 
thinking &lsquo;Do you think me then&mdash;a poor, red-headed 
Amateur, as Rogers does?&rsquo;&nbsp; That old Beast!&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t scruple to say so.</p>
<p>I am positively looking over my everlasting Crabbe again: he 
naturally comes in about the Fall of the <!-- page 55--><a 
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Year.&nbsp; 
Do you remember his wonderful &lsquo;October Day&rsquo;? <a

class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Before 
the Autumn closed,<br />
When Nature, ere her Winter Wars, reposed<br />
When from our Garden, as we looked above,<br />
No Cloud was seen; and nothing seem&rsquo;d to move;<br />
When the wide River was a Silver Sheet,<br />
And upon Ocean slept the unanchor&rsquo;d fleet:<br />
When the wing&rsquo;d Insect settled in our Sight,<br />
And waited Wind to recommence her flight.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, the Lady who believes her young Lover dead, and has 
vowed eternal Celibacy, sees him advancing, a portly, well to do,
middle aged man: and swears she won&rsquo;t have him: and does 
have him, etc.</p>
<p>Which reminds me that I want you to tell me if people in 
America read Crabbe.</p>

<p>It is very good of Mrs. Kemble to wish to <!-- page 56--><a 
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>tell me a 
story about Macready, and I shall be glad to know it.</p>
<p>Only&mdash;she should know that I am not writing his 
life&mdash;but editing his autobiographical reminiscences and 
diaries&mdash;and unless the anecdote could be introduced to 
explain or illustrate these, it would not be serviceable for my 
present purpose.</p>
<p>But for its own sake and for Macready&rsquo;s I should like to
be made acquainted with it.</p>
<p>I am making rapid way with the printing&mdash;in fact have got
to the end of what will be Vol. I. in slip&mdash;so that I hope 
the work may be out by or soon after Christmas, if the engravings
are also ready by that time.</p>
<p>It will be, I am sure, most interesting&mdash;and will 
surprise a great many people who did not at all know what 
Macready really was.</p>
<p>You last heard of me at Clovelly&mdash;where we spent a 
delightful month&mdash;more rain than was pleasant&mdash;but on 
the whole charming.&nbsp; I think I told you that Annie Thackeray
was there for a night&mdash;and that we bound her over not to 
make the reading public too well acquainted with the place, which
would not be good for it.</p>
<p>Since then&mdash;a fortnight at St. Julians&mdash;and the same
time at Tunbridge Wells&mdash;I coming up to town three times a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Your Letter about Megreedy, as Thackeray used to call him, is 
very interesting: I mean as connected with your Father 
also.&nbsp; Megreedy, with all his flat face, managed to look 
well as Virginius, didn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; And, as I thought, well
enough in Macbeth, except where he <i>would</i> stand with his 
mouth open (after the <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Witches had hailed him), till I 
longed to pitch something into it out of the Pit, the dear old 
Pit.&nbsp; How came <i>he</i> to play Henry IV. instead of your 
Father, in some Play I remember at C. G., though I did not see 
it?&nbsp; How well I remember your Father in Falconbridge (Young,
K. John) as he looked sideway and upward before the Curtain fell 
on his Speech.</p>
<p>Then his Petruchio: I remember his looking up, as the curtain 
fell at the end, to where he knew that Henry had taken 
me&mdash;some very upper Box.&nbsp; And I remember too his 
standing with his Hunting spear, looking with pleasure at pretty 
Miss Foote as Rosalind.&nbsp; He played well what was natural to 
him: the gallant easy Gentleman&mdash;I thought his Charles 
Surface rather cumbrous: but he was no longer young.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wister quite mistook the aim of my Query about Crabbe: I 
asked if he were read in America for the very reason that he is 
not read in England.&nbsp; And in the October <i>Cornhill</i> is 
an Article upon him (I hope not by Leslie Stephen), so ignorant 
and self-sufficient that I am more wroth than ever.&nbsp; The old
Story of &lsquo;Pope in worsted stockings&rsquo;&mdash;why I 
could cite whole Paragraphs of as fine texture as 
Moli&egrave;re&mdash;incapable of Epigram, the Jackanapes says of
&lsquo;our excellent Crabbe&rsquo;&mdash;why I could find fifty 
of the very best Epigrams in five minutes.&nbsp; But now do you 
care for him?&nbsp; &lsquo;Honour bright?&rsquo; as Sheridan used
to say.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I ever knew a Woman who did 
like C., except my Mother.&nbsp; What makes People (this stupid 
Reviewer among them) talk of worsted Stockings is <!-- page 
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>because of having read only his earlier works: when he 
himself talked of his Muse as</p>

Poor,&rsquo; <a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a" 
class="citation">[59a]</a></p>

<p>the Borough: Parish Register, etc.&nbsp; But it is his Tales 
of the Hall which discover him in silk Stockings; the subjects, 
the Scenery, the Actors, of a more Comedy kind: with, I say, 
Paragraphs, and Pages, of fine Moli&egrave;re style&mdash;only 
too often defaced by carelessness, disproportion, and 
&lsquo;longueurs&rsquo; intolerable.&nbsp; I shall leave my 
Edition of Tales of the Hall, made legible by the help of 
Scissors and Gum, with a word or two of Prose to bridge over 
pages of stupid Verse.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to try and 
supersede the Original, but, by the Abstract, to get People to 
read the whole, and so learn (as in Clarissa) how to get it all 
under command.&nbsp; I even wish that some one in America would 
undertake to publish&mdash;in whole, or part by part&mdash;my 
&lsquo;Readings in Crabbe,&rsquo; viz., Tales of the Hall: but no
one would let me do the one thing I can do.</p>
<p>I think you must repent having encouraged such a terrible 
Correspondent as myself: you have the remedy in your own hands, 
you know.&nbsp; I find that the Bronchitis I had in Spring 
returns upon me now: so I have to give up my Night walks, and

<p>Will you please to thank Mr. Furness for the trouble he has 
taken about Crabbe.&nbsp; The American Publisher is like the 
English, it appears, and both may be quite right.&nbsp; They 
certainly are right in not accepting anything except on very good
recommendation; and a Man&rsquo;s Fame is the best they can have 
for that purpose.&nbsp; I should not in the least be vext or even
disappointed at any rejection of my Crabbe, but it is not worth 
further trouble to any party to send across the Atlantic what 
may, most probably, <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>be returned with thanks and 
Compliments.&nbsp; And then Mr. Furness would feel bound to ask 
some other Publisher, and you to write to me about it.&nbsp; No, 
no!&nbsp; Thank him, if you please: you know I thank you: and 
then I will let the matter drop.</p>
<p>The Athen&aelig;um told me there was a Paper by Carlyle in the
January Fraser&mdash;on the old Norway Kings.&nbsp; Then People 
said it was not his: but his it is, surely enough (though I have 
no Authority but my own Judgment for saying so), and quite 
delightful.&nbsp; If missing something of his Prime, missing also
all his former &lsquo;Sound and Fury,&rsquo; etc., and as alive 
as ever.&nbsp; I had thoughts of writing to him on the subject, 
but have not yet done so.&nbsp; But pray do you read the Papers: 
there is a continuation in the February Fraser: and &lsquo;to be 
continued&rsquo; till ended, I suppose.</p>
<p>Your Photograph&mdash;Yes&mdash;I saw your Mother in it, as I 
saw her in you when you came to us in Woodbridge in 1852.&nbsp; 
That is, I saw her such as I had seen her in a little sixpenny 
Engraving in a &lsquo;Cottage Bonnet,&rsquo; something such as 
you wore when you stept out of your Chaise at the Crown Inn.</p>
<p>My Mother always said that your Mother was by far the most 
witty, sensible, and agreeable Woman she knew.&nbsp; I remember 
one of the very few delightful Dinner parties I ever was 
at&mdash;in St. James&rsquo; Place&mdash;(was it?) a Party of 
seven or eight, at a round Table, your Mother at the head of the 
Table, and Mrs. F. Kemble my next Neighbour.&nbsp; And really the
(almost) <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>only other pleasant Dinner was one 
you gave me and the Donnes in Savile Row, before going to see 
Wigan in &lsquo;Still Waters,&rsquo; which you said was 
<i>your</i> Play, in so far as you had suggested the Story from 
some French Novel.</p>
<p>I used to think what a deep current of melancholy was under 
your Mother&rsquo;s Humour.&nbsp; Not &lsquo;under,&rsquo; 
neither: for it came up as naturally to the surface as her 
Humour.&nbsp; My mother always said that one great charm in her 
was, her Naturalness.</p>
<p>If you read to your Company, pray do you ever read <i>the</i> 
Scene in the &lsquo;Spanish Tragedy&rsquo; quoted in C. 
Lamb&rsquo;s Specimens&mdash;such a Scene as (not being in Verse,
and quite familiar talk) I cannot help reading to my 
Guests&mdash;very few and far between&mdash;I mean by 
&lsquo;I,&rsquo; one who has no gift at all for reading except 
the feeling of a few things: and I can&rsquo;t help stumbling 
upon Tears in this.&nbsp; Nobody knows who wrote this one scene: 
it was thought Ben Jonson, who could no more have written it than
I who read it: for what else of his is it like?&nbsp; Whereas, 
Webster one fancies might have done it.&nbsp; It is not likely 
that you do not know this wonderful bit: but, if you have it not 
by heart almost, look for it again at once, and make others do so
by reading to them.</p>
<p>The enclosed Note from Mowbray D[onne] was the occasion of my 
writing thus directly to you.&nbsp; And yet I have spoken 
&lsquo;de omnibus other rebus&rsquo; first.&nbsp; But I venture 
to think that your feeling on the subject will be pretty much 
like my own, and so, no use in talking.</p>

Copy of Calderon, etc. <a name="citation64a"></a><a

a hundred Copies of all those things printed <i>when</i> printed:
and have not had a hundred friends to give them to&mdash;poor

likes&mdash;especially any Friend of yours.&nbsp; I think however
that your reading of them has gone most way to make your Lady 
ask.&nbsp; But, be that as it may, I will send you a Copy 
directly I return to my own Ch&acirc;teau, which I mean to do 
when the Daffodils have taken the winds of March. <a

at Bournemouth, after having wintered for the last ten years at 
Cannes.&nbsp; Bronchitis:&mdash;which (<i>sotto voce</i>) I have 
as yet kept Cold from coming to.&nbsp; But one knows one is not 
&lsquo;out of the Wood&rsquo; yet; May, if not March, being, you 
know, one of our worst Seasons.</p>
<p>I heard from our dear Donne a week ago; speaking with all his 
own blind and beautiful Love for his lately lost son; and telling
me that he himself keeps his heart going by Brandy.&nbsp; But he 
speaks of this with no Fear at all.&nbsp; He is going to leave 
Weymouth Street, but when, or for where, he does not say.&nbsp; 
He spoke of a Letter he had received from you some while ago.</p>
<p>Now about Crabbe, which also I am vext you should have trouble
about.&nbsp; I wrote to you the day after I had your two Letters,
with Mr. Furness&rsquo; enclosed, and said that, seeing the 
uncertainty of any success in the matter, I really would not 
bother you or him any more.&nbsp; You know it is but a little 
thing; which, even if a Publisher tried piece-meal, would very 
likely be scouted: I only meant &lsquo;piece-meal,&rsquo; by 
instalments: so as they could be discontinued if not liked.&nbsp;
But I suppose I must keep my Work&mdash;of paste, and 
scissors&mdash;for the benefit of the poor Friends who have had 
the benefit of my other Works.</p>
<p>Well: as I say, I wrote and posted my Letter at once, asking

<p>This bit of Letter is written to apprise you that, having to 
go to Woodbridge three days ago, I sent you by Post a little 
Volume of the Plays, and (what I had forgotten) a certain little 
Prose Dialogue <a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65" 
class="citation">[65]</a> done up with them.&nbsp; This is more 
than you wanted, but so it is.&nbsp; The Dialogue is a pretty 
thing in some respects: but disfigured by some confounded 
<i>smart</i> writing in parts: And this is all that needs saying 
about the whole concern.&nbsp; You must not think necessary to 
say anything more about it yourself, only that you receive the 
Book.&nbsp; If you do not, in a month&rsquo;s time, I shall 
suppose it has somehow lost its way over the Atlantic: <!-- page 
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and 
then I will send you the Plays you asked for, stitched 
together&mdash;and those only.</p>
<p>I hope you got my Letter (which you had not got when your last
was written) about Crabbe: for I explained in it why I did not 
wish to trouble you or Mr. Furness any more with such an 
uncertain business.&nbsp; Anyhow, I must ask you to thank him for
the trouble he had already taken, as I hope you know that I thank
you also for your share in it.</p>
<p>I scarce found a Crocus out in my Garden at home, and so have 
come back here till some green leaf shows itself.&nbsp; We are 
still under the dominion of North East winds, which keep people 
coughing as well as the Crocus under ground.&nbsp; Well, we hope 
to earn all the better Spring by all this Cold at its outset.</p>
<p>I have so often spoken of my fear of troubling you by all my 
Letters, that I won&rsquo;t say more on that score.&nbsp; I have 
heard no news of Donne since I wrote.&nbsp; I have been trying to
read Gil Blas and La Fontaine again; but, as before, do not 
relish either. <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"

by and by.</p>

<p>I wonder if this letter will smell of Tobacco: for it is 
written just after a Pipe, and just before going to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I wrote you a letter more than a fortnight ago&mdash;mislaid 
it&mdash;and now am rather ashamed to receive one from you 
thanking me beforehand for the mighty Book which I posted you a 
month ago.&nbsp; I only hope you will not feel bound to 
acknowledge [it] when it does reach you, I think I said so in the
Letter I wrote to go along with it.&nbsp; And I must say no more 
in the way of deprecating your Letters, after what you write 
me.&nbsp; Be assured that all my deprecations were for your sake,
not mine; but there&rsquo;s an end of them now.</p>
<p>I had a longish letter from Donne himself some while ago; 
indicating, I thought, <i>some</i> debility of Mind and 
Body.&nbsp; He said, however, he was going on very well.&nbsp; 
And a Letter from Mowbray (three or four days old) speaks of his 
Father as &lsquo;remarkably well.&rsquo;&nbsp; But these Donnes 
won&rsquo;t acknowledge Bodily any more than Mental fault in 
those they love.&nbsp; Blanche had been ill, of neuralgic Cold: 
Valentia not well: but both on the mending hand now.</p>
<p>It has been indeed the Devil of a Winter: and even 
now&mdash;To-day as I write&mdash;no better than it was three 
months ago.&nbsp; The Daffodils scarce dare take April, let alone
March; and I wait here till a Green Leaf shows itself about 
Woodbridge.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>I have been looking over four of Shakespeare&rsquo;s 
Plays, edited by Clark and Wright: editors of the 
&lsquo;Cambridge Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; These &lsquo;Select 
Plays&rsquo; are very well done, I think: Text, and Notes; 
although with somewhat too much of the latter.&nbsp; Hamlet, 
Macbeth, Tempest, and Shylock&mdash;I heard them talking in my 
room&mdash;all alive about me.</p>
<p>By the by&mdash;How did <i>you</i> read &lsquo;To-morrow and 
To-morrow, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; All the Macbeths I have heard took 
the opportunity to become melancholy when they came to this: and,
no doubt, some such change from Fury and Desperation was a relief
to the Actor, and perhaps to the Spectator.&nbsp; But I think it 
<i>should</i> all go in the same Whirlwind of Passion as the 
rest: Folly!&mdash;Stage Play!&mdash;Farthing Candle; Idiot, 
etc.&nbsp; Macready used to drop his Truncheon when he heard of 
the Queen&rsquo;s Death, and stand with his Mouth open for some 
while&mdash;which didn&rsquo;t become him.</p>
<p>I have not seen his Memoir: only an extract or two in the 
Papers.&nbsp; He always seemed to me an Actor by Art and Study, 
with some native Passion to inspire him.&nbsp; But as to 
Genius&mdash;we who have seen Kean!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you were acquainted with Sir A. Helps, 
<a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68" 
class="citation">[68]</a> whose Death (one of this Year&rsquo;s 
Doing) is much regretted by many.&nbsp; I scarcely knew him 
except at Cambridge forty years ago: and could never relish his 
Writings, amiable and sensible as they are.&nbsp; I suppose they 
will help to swell that substratum of <!-- page 69--><a

<i>Peat</i> (Carlyle somewhere calls it) <a 
name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69" 
class="citation">[69]</a> from [which] one or two living Trees 
stand out in a Century.&nbsp; So Shakespeare above all that Old 
Drama which he grew amidst, and which (all represented by him 
alone) might henceforth be left unexplored, with the exception of
a few twigs of Leaves gathered here and there&mdash;as in 
Lamb&rsquo;s Specimens.&nbsp; Is Carlyle himself&mdash;with all 
his Genius&mdash;to subside into the Level?&nbsp; Dickens, with 
all his Genius, but whose Men and Women act and talk already 
after a more obsolete fashion than Shakespeare&rsquo;s?&nbsp; I 
think some of Tennyson will survive, and drag the deader part 
along with it, I suppose.&nbsp; And (I doubt) Thackeray&rsquo;s 
terrible Humanity.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>: <i>April</i> 19/75.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote you a letter: enveloped it: then thought 
there was something in it you might 
misunderstand&mdash;Yes!&mdash;the written word across the 
Atlantic looking perhaps so different from what intended; so kept
my Letter in my pocket, and went my ways.&nbsp; This morning your
Letter of April 3 is forwarded to me; and I shall re-write the 
one thing that I yesterday wrote about&mdash;as I had intended to
do before your Letter came.&nbsp; Only, let me say that I am 
really ashamed that you should have taken the trouble to write 
again about my little, little, Book.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;what I wrote about yesterday, and am to-day about 
to re-write, is&mdash;Macready&rsquo;s Memoirs.&nbsp; You asked 
me in your previous Letter whether I had read them.&nbsp; 
No&mdash;I had not: and had meant to wait till they came down to 
Half-price on the Railway Stall before I bought them.&nbsp; But I
wanted to order something of my civil Woodbridge Bookseller: so 
took the course of ordering this Book, which I am now reading at 
Leisure: for it does not interest me enough <!-- page 71--><a 
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>to devour at 
once.&nbsp; It is however a very unaffected record of a very 
conscientious Man, and Artist; conscious (I think) that he was 
not a great Genius in his Profession, and conscious of his defect
of Self-control in his Morals.&nbsp; The Book is almost entirely 
about <i>himself</i>, <i>his</i> Studies, <i>his</i> Troubles, 
<i>his</i> Consolations, etc.; not from Egotism, I do think, but 
as the one thing he had to consider in writing a Memoir and 
Diary.&nbsp; Of course one expects, and wishes, that the 
Man&rsquo;s self should be the main subject; but one also wants 
something of the remarkable people he lived with, and of whom one
finds little here but that &lsquo;So-and-so came and 
went&rsquo;&mdash;scarce anything of what they said or did, 
except on mere business; Macready seeming to have no Humour; no 
intuition into Character, no Observation of those about him (how 
could he be a great Actor then?)&mdash;Almost the only exception 
I have yet reached is his Account of Mrs. Siddons, whom he 
worshipped: whom he acted with in her later years at Country 
Theatres: and who was as kind to him as she was even then 
heart-rending on the Stage.&nbsp; He was her Mr. Beverley: <a 
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71" 
class="citation">[71]</a> &lsquo;a very young husband,&rsquo; she
told him: but &lsquo;in the right way if he would study, study, 
study&mdash;and not marry till thirty.&rsquo;&nbsp; At another 
time, when he was on the stage, she stood at the side scene, 
called out &lsquo;Bravo, Sir, Bravo!&rsquo; and clapped her 
hands&mdash;all in sight of the Audience, who joined in her 
Applause.&nbsp; Macready also tells of her falling into such a 
Convulsion, as it <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>were, in Aspasia <a 
name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a" 
class="citation">[72a]</a> (what a subject for such a sacrifice!)
that the Curtain had to be dropped, and Macready&rsquo;s Father, 
and Holman, who were among the Audience, looked at each other to 
see which was whitest!&nbsp; This was the Woman whom people 
somehow came to look on as only majestic and terrible&mdash;I 
suppose, after Miss O&rsquo;Neill rose upon her Setting.</p>
<p>Well, but what I wrote about yesterday&mdash;a passage about 
you yourself.&nbsp; I fancy that he and you were very 
unsympathetic: nay, you have told me of some of his Egotisms 
toward you, &lsquo;who had scarce learned the rudiments of your 
Profession&rsquo; (as also he admits that he scarce had).&nbsp; 
But, however that may have been, his Diary records, 
&lsquo;Dec<sup>r</sup>. 20 (1838) Went to Covent Garden Theatre: 
on my way continued the perusal of Mrs. Butler&rsquo;s Play, 
which is a work of uncommon power.&nbsp; Finished the reading of 
Mrs. Butler&rsquo;s Play, which is one of the most powerful of 
the modern Plays I have seen&mdash;most painful&mdash;almost 
shocking&mdash;but full of Power, Poetry and Pathos.&nbsp; She is
one of the most remarkable women of the present Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So you see that if he thought you deficient in the Art which 
you (like himself) had unwillingly to resort to, you were 
efficient in the far greater Art of supplying that material on 
which the Histrionic must depend.&nbsp; (N.B.&mdash;Which play of
yours?&nbsp; Not surely the &lsquo;English Tragedy&rsquo; unless 
shown to him in MS.? <a name="citation72b"></a><a 
href="#footnote72b" class="citation">[72b]</a> <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Come: I have 
sent you my Translations: you should give me your Original 
Plays.&nbsp; When I get home, I will send you an old Scratch by 
Thackeray of yourself in Louisa of Savoy&mdash;shall I?)</p>
<p>On the whole, I find Macready (so far as I have gone) a just, 
generous, religious, and affectionate Man; on the whole, humble 
too!&nbsp; One is well content to assure oneself of this; but it 
is not worth spending 28<i>s.</i> upon.</p>
<p>Macready would have made a better Scholar&mdash;or 
Divine&mdash;than Actor, I think: a Gentleman he would have been 
in any calling, I believe, in spite of his Temper&mdash;which he 
acknowledges, laments, and apologizes for, on reflection.</p>
<p>Now, here is enough of my small writing for your 
reading.&nbsp; I have been able to read, and admire, some 
Corneille lately: as to Racine&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Ce n&rsquo;est pas
mon homme</i>,&rsquo; as Catharine of Russia said of him.&nbsp; 
Now I am at Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;&rsquo;s delightful 
Letters; I should like to send you a Bouquet of Extracts: but 
must have done now, being always yours</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>: <i>May</i> 16/75</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I have been wishing to send you Carlyle&rsquo;s Norway Kings, 
and oh! such a delightful Paper of <!-- page 74--><a 
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>Spedding&rsquo;s on the Text of Richard III. <a 
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74" 
class="citation">[74]</a>&nbsp; But I have waited till I should 
hear from you, knowing that you <i>will</i> reply!&nbsp; And not 
feeling sure, till I hear, whether you are not on your way to 
England Eastward ho!&mdash;even as I am now writing!&mdash;Or, I 
fancy&mdash;should you not be well?&nbsp; Anyhow, I shall wait 
till some authentic news of yourself comes to me.&nbsp; I should 
not mind sending you Carlyle&mdash;why, yes!&nbsp; I <i>will</i> 
send him!&nbsp; But old Spedding&mdash;which is only a 
Proof&mdash;I won&rsquo;t send till I know that you are still 
where you were to receive it&mdash;Oh! such a piece of musical 
criticism! without the least pretence to being Musick: as dry as 
he can make it, in fact.&nbsp; But he does, with utmost 
politeness, smash the Cambridge Editors&rsquo; Theory about the 
Quarto and Folio Text of R. III.&mdash;in a way that perhaps Mr. 
Furness might like to see.</p>
<p>Spedding says that Irving&rsquo;s Hamlet is 
simply&mdash;<i>hideous</i>&mdash;a strong expression for 
Spedding to use.&nbsp; But&mdash;(lest I should think his 
condemnation was only the Old Man&rsquo;s fault of depreciating 
all that is new), he extols Miss Ellen Terry&rsquo;s Portia as 
simply <i>a perfect Performance</i>: remembering (he says) all 
the while how fine was Fanny Kemble&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Now, all this 
you shall read for yourself, when I have token of your 
Whereabout, and Howabout: for I will send you Spedding&rsquo;s 
Letter, as well as his Paper.</p>
<p>Spedding won&rsquo;t go and see Salvini&rsquo;s Othello, 
because <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>he does not know Italian, and also 
because he hears that Salvini&rsquo;s is a different Conception 
of Othello from Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t 
understand either reason; but Spedding is (as Carlyle <a 
name="citation75a"></a><a href="#footnote75a" 
class="citation">[75a]</a> wrote me of his Bacon) the 
&lsquo;invincible, and victorious.&rsquo;&nbsp; At any rate, I 
can&rsquo;t beat him.&nbsp; Irving I never could believe in as 
Hamlet, after seeing part of his famous Performance of a 
Melodrama called &lsquo;The Bells&rsquo; three or four years 
ago.&nbsp; But the Pollocks, and a large World beside, think him 
a Prodigy&mdash;whom Spedding thinks&mdash;a Monster!&nbsp; To 
this Complexion is the English Drama come.</p>
<p>I wonder if your American Winter has transformed itself to 
such a sudden Summer as here in Old England.&nbsp; I returned to 
my Woodbridge three weeks ago: not a leaf on the Trees: in ten 
days they were all green, and people&mdash;perspiring, I suppose 
one must say.&nbsp; Now again, while the Sun is quite as Hot, the
Wind has swerved round to the East&mdash;so as one broils on one 
side and freezes on t&rsquo;other&mdash;and I&mdash;the Great 
Twalmley <a name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b" 
class="citation">[75b]</a>&mdash;am keeping indoors from an 
Intimation of Bronchitis.&nbsp; I think it is time for one to 
leave the Stage oneself.</p>
<p>I heard from Mowbray Donne some little while ago; as he said 
nothing (I think) of his Father, I conclude that there is nothing
worse of him to be said.&nbsp; He (the Father) has a Review of 
Macready&mdash;laudatory, I suppose&mdash;in the Edinburgh, and 
<i>Mr.</i> <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Helen Faucit (Martin) as injurious a 
one in the Quarterly: the reason of the latter being (it is 
supposed) because <i>Mrs.</i> H. F. is not noticed except just by
name.&nbsp; To this Complexion also!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ever yours,<br />
E. F.G.</p>
<p>Since writing as above, your Letter comes; as you do not speak
of moving, I shall send Spedding and Carlyle by Post to you, in 
spite of the Loss of Income you tell me of which would (I doubt) 
close up <i>my</i> thoughts some while from such 
speculations.&nbsp; I do not think <i>you</i> will take trouble 
so to heart.&nbsp; Keep Spedding for me: Carlyle I don&rsquo;t 
want again.&nbsp; Tired as you&mdash;and I&mdash;are of 
Shakespeare Commentaries, you will like this.</p>
<h2>XXX.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>: <i>July</i> 22/75.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I have abstained from writing since you wrote me how busily 
your Pen was employed for the Press: I wished more than ever to 
spare you the trouble of answering me&mdash;which I knew you 
would not forgo.&nbsp; And now you will feel called upon, I 
suppose, though I would fain spare you.</p>
<p>Though I date from this place still, I have been away from it 
at my own Woodbridge house for two months and more; only 
returning here indeed to <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>help make a 
better Holiday for a poor Lad who is shut up in a London Office 
while his Heart is all for Out-of-Door, Country, Sea, etc.&nbsp; 
We have been having wretched Holyday weather, to be sure: rain, 
mist, and wind; St. Swithin at his worst: but all better than the
hateful London Office&mdash;to which he must return the day after
To-morrow, poor Fellow!</p>
<p>I suppose you will see&mdash;if you have not yet 
seen&mdash;Tennyson&rsquo;s Q. Mary.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know 
what to say about it; but the Times says it is the finest Play 
since Shakespeare; and the Spectator that it is superior to Henry
VIII.&nbsp; Pray do you say something of it, when you 
write:&mdash;for I think you must have read it before that time 
comes.</p>
<p>Then Spedding has written a delicious Paper in Fraser about 
the late Representation of The Merchant of Venice, and his E. 
Terry&rsquo;s perfect personation of his perfect Portia.&nbsp; I 
cannot agree with him in all he says&mdash;for one thing, I must 
think that Portia made &lsquo;a hole in her manners&rsquo; when 
she left Antonio trembling for his Life while she all the while 
[knew] how to defeat the Jew by that knowledge of the Venetian 
Law which (oddly enough) the Doge knew nothing about.&nbsp; Then 
Spedding thinks that Shylock has been so pushed forward ever 
since Macklin&rsquo;s time as to preponderate over all the rest 
in a way that Shakespeare never intended. <a 
name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77" 
class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; But, if Shakespeare did not <!-- 
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>intend this, he certainly erred in devoting so much of 
his most careful and most powerful writing to a Character which 
he meant to be subsidiary, and not principal.&nbsp; But Spedding 
is more likely to be right than I: right or wrong he pleads his 
cause as no one else can.&nbsp; His Paper is in this July number 
of Fraser: I would send it you if you had more time for reading 
than your last Letter speaks of; I <i>will</i> send if you 
wish.</p>
<p>I have not heard of Donne lately: he had been staying at 
Lincoln with Blakesley, the Dean: and is now, I suppose, at 
Chislehurst, where he took a house for a month.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">And I am yours ever and sincerely<br

<p>Now, my dear Mrs. Kemble, you will have to call me &lsquo;a 
Good Creature,&rsquo; as I have found out a Copy of your capital 
Paper, <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78" 
class="citation">[78]</a> and herewith post it to you.&nbsp; Had 
I not found this Copy (which Smith &amp; Elder <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>politely 
found for me) I should have sent you one of my own, cut out from 
a Volume of Essays by other friends, Spedding, etc., on condition
that you should send me a Copy of such Reprint as you may make of
it in America.&nbsp; It is extremely interesting; and I always 
think that your Theory of the Intuitive <i>versus</i> the 
Analytical and Philosophical applies to the other Arts as well as
that of the Drama.&nbsp; Mozart couldn&rsquo;t tell how he made a
Tune; even a whole Symphony, he said, unrolled itself out of a 
leading idea by no logical process.&nbsp; Keats said that no 
Poetry was worth [anything] unless it came spontaneously as 
Leaves to a Tree, etc. <a name="citation79"></a><a 
href="#footnote79" class="citation">[79]</a>&nbsp; I have no 
faith in your Works of Art done on Theory and Principle, like 
Wordsworth, Wagner, Holman Hunt, etc.</p>
<p>But, one thing you can do on Theory, and carry it well into 
Practice: which is&mdash;to write your Letter on Paper which does
not let the Ink through, so that (according to your mode of 
paging) your last Letter was crossed: I really thought it so at 
first, and really had very hard work to make it out&mdash;some 
parts indeed still defying my Eyes.&nbsp; What I read of your 
remarks on Portia, etc., is so good that I wish to keep it: but 
still I think I shall enclose you a scrap to justify my 
complaint.&nbsp; It was almost by Intuition, not on Theory, that 
I deciphered what I did.&nbsp; Pray you amend this.&nbsp; My MS. 
is bad enough, and on that very account I would avoid diaphanous 
Paper.&nbsp; Are you not ashamed?</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>I shall send you Spedding&rsquo;s beautiful Paper on the
Merchant of Venice <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a> if I can lay hands on it: but at 
present my own room is given up to a fourth Niece (Angel that I 
am!)&nbsp; You would see that S[pedding] agrees with you about 
Portia, and in a way that I am sure must please you.&nbsp; But 
(so far as I can decipher that fatal Letter) you say nothing at 
all to me of the other Spedding Paper I sent to you (about the 
Cambridge Editors, etc.), which I must have back again indeed, 
unless you wish to keep it, and leave me to beg another 
Copy.&nbsp; Which to be sure I can do, and will, if your heart is
set upon it&mdash;which I suppose it is not at all.</p>
<p>I have not heard of Donne for so long a time, that I am 
uneasy, and have written to Mowbray to hear.&nbsp; M[owbray] 
perhaps is out on his Holyday, else I think he would have replied
at once.&nbsp; And &lsquo;no news may be the Good 
News.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have no news to tell of myself; I am much as I have been for
the last four months: which is, a little ricketty.&nbsp; But I 
get out in my Boat on the River three or four hours a Day when 
possible, and am now as ever yours sincerely</p>

<p>I duly received your last legible Letter, and Spedding&rsquo;s
Paper: for both of which all Thanks.&nbsp; But you must do 
something more for me.&nbsp; I see by Notes and Queries that you 
are contributing Recollections to some American Magazine; I want 
you to tell me where I can get this, with all the back Numbers in
which you have written.</p>
<p>I return the expected favour (Hibernic&eacute;) with the 
enclosed Prints, one of which is rather a Curiosity: that of Mrs.
Siddons by Lawrence when he was <i>&aelig;tat.</i> 13.&nbsp; The 
other, done from a Cast of herself by herself, is only remarkable
as being almost a Copy of this early Lawrence&mdash;at least, in 
Attitude, if not in Expression.&nbsp; I dare say you have seen 
the Cast itself.&nbsp; And now for a Story better than either 
Print: a story to which Mrs. Siddons&rsquo; glorious name leads 
me, burlesque as it is.</p>
<p>You may know there is a French Opera of Macbeth&mdash;by 
Ch&eacute;lard.&nbsp; This was being played at the Dublin 
Theatre&mdash;Viardot, I think, the Heroine.&nbsp; However that 
may be, the Curtain drew up for the Sleep-walking Scene; Doctor

<p>Your hot Colorado Summer is over; and you are now coming to

show here, you know: none of that Violet which I think you have 
told me of as mixing with the Gold in the Foliage.&nbsp; Now it 
is that I hear that Spirit that Tennyson once told of talking to

think he has dropt that little Poem <a name="citation82b"></a><a

you, ready as it offers itself to my Memory.&nbsp; Mrs. Frere of 
Cambridge used to sing it as she could sing the Classical 
Ballad&mdash;to a fairly expressive tune: but there is a movement
(Trio, I think) in one of dear old Haydn&rsquo;s Symphonies 
almost made for it.&nbsp; Who else but Haydn for the 
Pastoral!&nbsp; Do you remember his blessed Chorus of 
&lsquo;Come, gentle Spring,&rsquo; that open the Seasons?&nbsp; 
Oh, it is something to remember the old Ladies who sang that 
Chorus at the old Ancient Concerts rising with Music in hand to 
sing that lovely piece under old Greatorex&rsquo;s 
Direction.&nbsp; I have never heard Haydn and Handel so well as 
in those old Rooms with those old Performers, who still retained 
the Tradition of those old Masters.&nbsp; Now it is getting 
Midnight; but so mild&mdash;this October 4&mdash;that I am going 
to smoke one Pipe outdoors&mdash;with a little Brandy and water 
to keep the Dews off.&nbsp; I told you I had not been well all

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>My last Letter asked you how and where I could get at your 
Papers; this is to say, I have got <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>them, thanks 
to the perseverance of our Woodbridge Bookseller, who would not 
be put off by his London Agent, and has finally procured me the 
three Numbers <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84" 
class="citation">[84]</a> which contain your 
&lsquo;Gossip.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now believe me; I am delighted with 
it; and only wish it might run on as long as I live: which 
perhaps it may.&nbsp; Of course somewhat of my Interest results 
from the Times, Persons, and Places you write of; almost all more
or less familiar to me; but I am quite sure that very few could 
have brought all before me as you have done&mdash;with what the 
Painters call, so free, full, and flowing a touch.&nbsp; I 
suppose this &lsquo;Gossip&rsquo; is the Memoir you told me you 
were about; three or four years ago, I think: or perhaps 
Selections from it; though I hardly see how your Recollections 
could be fuller.&nbsp; No doubt your Papers will all be collected
into a Book; perhaps it would have been financially better for 
you to have so published it now.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, 
you will have the advantage of writing with more freedom and ease
in the Magazine, knowing that you can alter, contract, or 
amplify, in any future Re-publication.&nbsp; It gives me such 
pleasure to like, and honestly say I like, this 
work&mdash;and&mdash;I know I&rsquo;m right in such matters, 
though I can&rsquo;t always give the reason why I like, or 
don&rsquo;t like, Dr. Fell: as much wiser People can&mdash;who 
reason themselves quite wrong.</p>
<p>I suppose you were at School in the Rue 
d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>near about the time (you don&rsquo;t 
give dates enough, I think&mdash;there&rsquo;s one fault for 
you!)&mdash;about the time when we lived there: I suppose you 
were somewhat later, however: for assuredly my Mother and yours 
would have been together often&mdash;Oh, but your Mother was not 
there, only you&mdash;at School.&nbsp; We were there in 
1817-18&mdash;signalised by The Great Murder&mdash;that of 
Fuald&egrave;s&mdash;one of the most interesting events in all 
History to me, I am sorry to say.&nbsp; For in that point I do 
not say I am right.&nbsp; But that Rue 
d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me&mdash;do you not remember the house 
cornering on the Champs Elys&eacute;es with some ornaments in 
stone of Flowers and Garlands&mdash;belonging to a Lord 
Courtenay, I believe?&nbsp; And do you remember a 
P&eacute;pini&egrave;re over the way; and, over that, seeing that
Temple in the Beaujon Gardens with the Parisians descending and 
ascending in Cars?&nbsp; And (I think) at the end of the street, 
the Church of St. Philippe du Roule?&nbsp; Perhaps I shall see in
your next Number that you do remember all these things.</p>
<p>Well: I was pleased with some other Papers in your Magazine: 
as those on V. Hugo, <a name="citation85a"></a><a 
href="#footnote85a" class="citation">[85a]</a> and 
Tennyson&rsquo;s Queen Mary: <a name="citation85b"></a><a 
href="#footnote85b" class="citation">[85b]</a> I doubt not that 
Criticism on English Writers is likely to be more impartial over 
the Atlantic, and not biassed by Clubs, Coteries, etc.&nbsp; I 
always say that we in the Country are safer Judges than those of 
even better Wits in London: not being prejudiced so much, whether
by personal acquaintance, <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>or party, or 
Fashion.&nbsp; I see that Professor Wilson said much the same 
thing to Willis forty years ago.</p>
<p>I have written to Donne to tell him of your Papers, and that I
will send him my Copies if he cannot get them.&nbsp; Mowbray 
wrote me word that his Father, who has bought the house in 
Weymouth Street, was now about returning to it, after some 
Alterations made.&nbsp; Mowbray talks of paying me a little Visit
here&mdash;he and his Wife&mdash;at the End of this 
month:&mdash;when what Good Looks we have will all be gone.</p>
<p>Farewell for the present; I count on your Gossip: and believe 
me (what it serves to make me feel more vividly)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>The Mowbray Donnes have been staying some days <a 
name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86" 
class="citation">[86]</a> with me&mdash;very pleasantly.&nbsp; Of
course I got them to tell me of the fine things in London: among 
the rest, the Artists whose Photos they sent me, and I here 
enclose.&nbsp; The Lady, they tell me&mdash;(Spedding&rsquo;s 
present Idol)&mdash;is better than her Portrait&mdash;which would
not have so enamoured Bassanio.&nbsp; Irving&rsquo;s, they say, 
is flattered.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis a handsome face, surely; and 
one that should do for Hamlet&mdash;if it were not for that large
Ear&mdash;do you notice?&nbsp; I <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>was tempted 
to send it to you, because it reminds me of some of your Family: 
your Father, most of all, as Harlowe has painted him in that 
famous Picture of the Trial Scene. <a name="citation87a"></a><a 
href="#footnote87a" class="citation">[87a]</a>&nbsp; It is odd to
me that the fine Engraving from that Picture&mdash;once so 
frequent&mdash;is scarce seen now: it has seemed strange to me to
meet People who never even heard of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you have a little Grudge against Mrs. 
Siddons&mdash;perhaps you will say you have not&mdash;all my 
fancy.&nbsp; I think it was noticed at Cambridge that your 
Brother John scarce went to visit her when she was staying with 
that Mrs. Frere, whom you don&rsquo;t remember with 
pleasure.&nbsp; She did talk much and loud: but she had a fine 
Woman&rsquo;s heart underneath, and she could sing a classical 
Song: as also some of Handel, whom she had studied with 
Bartleman.&nbsp; But she never could have sung the Ballad with 
the fulness which you describe in Mrs. Arkwright. <a 
name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b" 
class="citation">[87b]</a></p>
<p>Which, together with your mention of your American isolation, 
reminds me of some Verses of Hood, with which I will break your 
Heart a little.&nbsp; They are not so very good, neither: but I, 
in England as I am, and like to be, cannot forget them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It always runs in my head to a little German Air, common 
enough in our younger days&mdash;which I will make a note of, and
you will, I dare say, remember at once.</p>
<p>I doubt that what I have written is almost as illegible as 
that famous one of yours: in which however only [paper] was in 
fault: <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b" 
class="citation">[88b]</a> and now I shall scarce mend the matter
by taking a steel pen instead of that old quill, which certainly 
did fight upon its Stumps.</p>
<p>Well now&mdash;Professor Masson of Edinburgh has asked me to 
join him and seventy-nine others in celebrating Carlyle&rsquo;s 
eightieth Birthday on December 4&mdash;with the Presentation of a
Gold Medal with Carlyle&rsquo;s own Effigy upon it, and a 
congratulatory Address.&nbsp; I should have thought such a 
Measure would be ridiculous to Carlyle; but I suppose Masson must
have ascertained his Pleasure from some intimate Friend of 
C.&rsquo;s: otherwise he would not have known of my Existence for
one.&nbsp; However Spedding and Pollock tell me that, after some 
hesitation like my own, they judged best to consent.&nbsp; Our 
Names are even to be attached somehow to a&mdash;White Silk, or 
Satin, Scroll!&nbsp; Surely Carlyle cannot be aware of 
that?&nbsp; I hope devoutly that my Name come too late <!-- page 
89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>for 
its Satin Apotheosis; but, if it do not, I shall apologise to 
Carlyle for joining such Mummery.&nbsp; I only followed the 
Example of my Betters.</p>
<p>Now I must shut up, for Photos and a Line of Music is to come 
in.&nbsp; I was so comforted to find that your Mother had some 
hand in Dr. Kitchener&rsquo;s Cookery Book, <a 
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89" 
class="citation">[89]</a> which has always been Guide, 
Philosopher, and Friend in such matters.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help
liking a Cookery Book.</p>

<p>No: I never turned my tragic hand on Fuald&egrave;s; but I 
remember well being taken in 1818 to the Ambigu Comique to see 
the &lsquo;Ch&acirc;teau de Paluzzi,&rsquo; which was said to be 
founded on that great Murder.&nbsp; I still distinctly remember a
Closet, from which came some guilty Personage.&nbsp; It is not 
only the Murder itself that impressed me, but the Scene it was 
enacted in; the ancient half-Spanish City of Rodez, with its 
River Aveyron, its lonely Boulevards, its great Cathedral, under 
which the Deed was done in the &lsquo;Rue des 
Hebdomadiers.&rsquo;&nbsp; I suppose you don&rsquo;t see, or 
read, our present Whitechapel Murder&mdash;a nasty thing, not at 
all to my liking.&nbsp; The Name of the Murderer&mdash;as no one 
doubts he is, whatever the Lawyers may disprove&mdash;is the same
as that famous Man of Taste who wrote on the Fine Arts in the 
London Magazine under the name of Janus Weathercock, <a 
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"

Wife, Wife&rsquo;s Mother and Sister after insuring their 
Lives.&nbsp; De Quincey (who was one of the Magazine) has one of 
his Essays about this wretch.</p>

rather troublesome to read.&nbsp; In three or four days we shall

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>You will say I am a very good Creature indeed, for beginning 
to answer your Letter the very day it reaches me.&nbsp; But so it
happens that this same day also comes a Letter from Laurence the 
Painter, who tells me something of poor Minnie&rsquo;s Death, <a 
name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b" 
class="citation">[90b]</a> which answers to the Query in your 
Letter.&nbsp; Laurence sends me Mrs. Brookfield&rsquo;s Note to 
him: from which I quote to you&mdash;no!&mdash;I will make bold 
to send you her Letter itself!&nbsp; Laurence says he is 
generally averse to showing others a Letter meant for himself 
(the little Gentleman that he is!), but he ventures in this case,
knowing me to be an old friend of the Family.&nbsp; And so I 
venture to post it over the Atlantic <!-- page 91--><a 
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>to you who 
take a sincere Interest in them also.&nbsp; I wonder if I am 
doing wrong?</p>
<p>In the midst of all this mourning comes out a new Volume of 
Thackeray&rsquo;s Drawings&mdash;or Sketches&mdash;as I foresaw 
it would be, too much Caricature, not so good as much [of] his 
old Punch; and with none of the better things I wanted them to 
put in&mdash;for his sake, as well as the 
Community&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I do not wonder at the Publisher&rsquo;s
obstinacy, but I wonder that Annie T. did not direct 
otherwise.&nbsp; I am convinced I can hear Thackeray saying, when
such a Book as this was proposed to him&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, 
come&mdash;there has been enough of all this&rsquo;&mdash;and 
crumpling up the Proof in that little hand of his.&nbsp; For a 
curiously little hand he had, uncharacteristic of the grasp of 
his mind: I used to consider it half inherited from the Hindoo 
people among whom he was born. <a name="citation91"></a><a 
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>I dare say I told you of the Proposal to congratulate Carlyle 
on his eightieth Birthday; and probably some <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Newspaper has
told you of the Address, and the Medal, and the White Satin Roll 
to which our eighty names were to be attached.&nbsp; I thought 
the whole Concern, Medal, Address, and Satin Roll, a very Cockney
thing; and devoutly hoped my own illustrious name would arrive 
too late.&nbsp; I could not believe that Carlyle would like the 
Thing: but it appears by his published Answer that he did.&nbsp; 
He would not, ten years ago, I think.&nbsp; Now&mdash;talking of 
illustrious names, etc., oh, my dear Mrs. Kemble, your sincere 
old Regard for my Family and myself has made you say 
more&mdash;of one of us, at least&mdash;than the World will care 
to be told: even if your old Regard had not magnified our lawful 
Deserts.&nbsp; But indeed it has done so: in Quality, as well as 
in Quantity.&nbsp; I know I am not either squeamishly, or 
hypocritically, saying all this: I am sure I know myself better 
than you do, and take a juster view of my pretensions.&nbsp; I 
think you Kembles are almost Donnes in your determined regard, 
and (one may say) Devotion to old Friends, etc.&nbsp; A 
rare&mdash;a noble&mdash;Failing!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&mdash;Well, I 
shall not say any more: you will know that I do not the less 
thank you for publickly speaking of [me] as I never was spoken of
before&mdash;only <i>too</i> well.&nbsp; Indeed, this is so; and 
when you come to make a Book of your Papers, I shall make you cut
out something.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be angry with me now&mdash;no, I
know you will not. <a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"

<h2>XXXVI.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>: <i>Febr</i>: 2/76.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Mrs. Kemble, I have done you a little good 
turn.&nbsp; Some days ago I was talking to my Brother John (I 
dared not show him!) of what you had said of my Family in your 
Gossip.&nbsp; He was <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>extremely interested: and wished much
that I [would] convey you his old hereditary remembrances.&nbsp; 
But, beside that, he wished you to have a Miniature of your 
Mother which my Mother had till she died.&nbsp; It is a full 
length; in a white Dress, with blue Scarf, looking and tending 
with extended Arms upward in a Blaze of Light.&nbsp; My Brother 
had heard my Mother&rsquo;s History of the Picture, but could not
recall it.&nbsp; I fancy it was before your Mother&rsquo;s 
Marriage.&nbsp; The Figure is very beautiful, and the Face also: 
like your Sister Adelaide, and your Brother Henry both.&nbsp; I 
think you will be pleased with this: and my Brother is very 
pleased that you should have it.&nbsp; Now, how to get it over to
you is the Question; I believe I must get my little Quaritch, the
Bookseller, who has a great American connection, to get it safely
over to you.&nbsp; But if you know of any surer means, let me 
know.&nbsp; It is framed: and would look much better if some 
black edging were streaked into the Gold Frame; a thing I 
sometimes do only with a strip of Black Paper.&nbsp; The old Plan
of Black and Gold Frames is much wanted where Yellow predominates
in the Picture.&nbsp; Do you know I have a sort of Genius for 
Picture-framing, which is an Art People may despise, as they do 
the Milliner&rsquo;s: but you know how the prettiest Face may be 
hurt, and the plainest improved, by the Bonnet; and I find that 
(like the Bonnet, I suppose) you can only judge of the Frame, by 
trying it on.&nbsp; I used to tell some Picture Dealers they had 
better hire me for such <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Millinery: but I have not had much 
Scope for my Art down here.&nbsp; So now you have a little 
Lecture along with the Picture.</p>
<p>Now, as you are to thank me for this good turn done to you, so
have I to thank you for Ditto to me.&nbsp; The mention of my 
little Quaritch reminds me.&nbsp; He asked me for copies of 
Agamemnon, to give to some of his American Customers who asked 
for them; and I know from whom they must have somehow heard of 
it.&nbsp; And now, what Copies I had being gone, he is going, at 
his own risk, to publish a little Edition.&nbsp; The worst is, he
<i>will</i> print it pretentiously, I fear, as if one thought it 
very precious: but the Truth is, I suppose he calculates on a few
Buyers who will give what will repay him.&nbsp; One of my 
Patrons, Professor Norton, of Cambridge Mass., has sent me a 
second Series of Lowell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Among my Books,&rsquo; 
which I shall be able to acknowledge with sincere praise.&nbsp; I
had myself bought the first Series.&nbsp; Lowell may do for 
English Writers something as Ste. Beuve has done for French: and 
one cannot give higher Praise. <a name="citation97a"></a><a 
href="#footnote97a" class="citation">[97a]</a></p>
<p>There has been an absurd Bout in the Athen&aelig;um <a 
name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b" 
class="citation">[97b]</a> between Miss Glyn and some Drury Lane 
Authorities.&nbsp; She wrote a Letter to say that she would not 
have played Cleopatra in a revival of Antony and Cleopatra for 
&pound;1000 a line, I believe, so curtailed and mangled was 
it.&nbsp; Then comes a Miss Wallis, who played the <!-- page 
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Part,
to declare that &lsquo;the Veteran&rsquo; (Miss G.) had wished to
play the Part as it was acted: and furthermore comes Mr. 
Halliday, who somehow manages and adapts at D. L., to assert that
the Veteran not only wished to enact the Desecration, but did 
enact it for many nights when Miss Wallis was indisposed.&nbsp; 
Then comes Isabel forward again&mdash;but I really forget what 
she said.&nbsp; I never saw her but once&mdash;in the Duchess of 
Malfi&mdash;very well: better, I dare say, than anybody now; but 
one could not remember a Word, a Look, or an Action.&nbsp; She 
speaks in her Letter of being brought up in the grand School and 
Tradition of the Kembles.</p>
<p>I am glad, somehow, that you liked Macready&rsquo;s 
Reminiscences: so honest, so gentlemanly in the main, so pathetic
even in his struggles to be a better Man and Actor.&nbsp; You, I 
think, feel with him in your Distaste for the Profession.</p>
<p>I write you tremendous long Letters, which you can please 
yourself about reading through.&nbsp; I shall write Laurence your
message of Remembrance to him.&nbsp; I had a longish Letter from 
Donne, who spoke of himself as well enough, only living by strict
Rule in Diet, Exercise, etc.</p>
<p>We have had some remarkable Alternations of Cold and Hot here 
too: but nothing like the extremes you tell me of on the other 
side of the Page.</p>
<p>Lionel Tennyson (second Son), who answered my half-yearly 
Letter to his father, tells me they had <!-- page 99--><a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I ought to have written before to apprise you of your 
Mother&rsquo;s Miniature being sent off&mdash;by Post.&nbsp; On 
consideration, we judged that to be the safest and speediest way:
the Post Office here telling us that it was not too large or 
heavy so to travel: without the Frame.&nbsp; As, however, our 
Woodbridge Post Office is not very well-informed, I shall be very
glad to hear it has reached you, in its double case: wood within,
and tin without (quite unordered and unnecessary), which must 
make you think you receive a present of Sardines.&nbsp; You lose,
you see, the Benefit of my exalted Taste in respect of Framing, 
which I had settled to perfection.&nbsp; Pray get a small Frame, 
concaving inwardly (Ogee pattern, I believe), which leads the 
Eyes into the Picture: whereas a Frame convexing outwardly leads 
the Eye away from the Picture; a very good thing in many cases, 
but not needed in this.&nbsp; I dare say the Picture (faded as it
is) will look poor to you till enclosed and set off by a proper 
Frame.&nbsp; <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>And the way is, as with a Bonnet (on
which you know much depends even with the fairest face), to try 
one on before ordering it home.&nbsp; That is, if you choose to 
indulge in some more ornamental Frame than the quite simple one I
have before named.&nbsp; Indeed, I am not sure if the Picture 
would not look best in a plain gold Flat (as it is called) 
without Ogee, or any ornament whatsoever.&nbsp; But try it on 
first: and then you can at least please yourself, if not the 
Terrible Modiste who now writes to you.&nbsp; My Brother is very 
anxious you should have the Picture, and wrote to me again to 
send you his hereditary kind Regards.&nbsp; I ought to be sending
you his Note&mdash;which I have lost.&nbsp; Instead of that, I 
enclose one from poor Laurence to whom I wrote your kind message;
and am as ever</p>

should wear a little Rouge even by Daylight), the 
&lsquo;performing&rsquo; Elephants, the helmeted Cavaliers, and 
last, the Owner (I suppose) as &lsquo;the modern Gentleman&rsquo;
driving four-in-hand.</p>
<p>This intoxication over, I return to my Duties&mdash;to say 
that the Engraving is from a Painting by &lsquo;P. Jean,&rsquo; 
engraved by Vendramini: published by John Thompson in 1802, and 
dedicated to the &lsquo;Hon. W. R. Spencer&rsquo;&mdash;(who, I 
suppose, was the &lsquo;Vers-de Soci&eacute;t&eacute;&rsquo; Man 
of the Day; and perhaps the owner of the original: whether now 
yours, or not.&nbsp; All <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>this I tell
you in case the Print should not arrive in fair time: and you 
have but to let me know, and another shall post after it.</p>
<p>I have duly written my Brother your thanks for his Present, 
and your sincere Gratification in possessing it.&nbsp; He is very
glad it has so much pleased you.&nbsp; But he can only surmise 
thus much more of its history&mdash;that it belonged to my 
Grandfather before my Mother: he being a great lover of the 
Theatre, and going every night I believe to old Covent Garden or 
old Drury Lane&mdash;names really musical to me&mdash;old 
Melodies.</p>
<p>I think I wrote to you about the Framing.&nbsp; I always say 
of that, as of other Millinery (on which so much depends), the 
best way is&mdash;to try on the Bonnet before ordering it; which 
you can do by the materials which all Carvers and Gilders in this
Country keep by them.&nbsp; I have found even my 
Judgment&mdash;the Great Twalmley&rsquo;s 
Judgment&mdash;sometimes thrown out by not condescending to this;
in this, as in so many other things, so very little making all 
the Difference.&nbsp; I should not think that Black next the 
Picture would do so well: but try, try: try on the Bonnet: and if
you please yourself&mdash;inferior Modiste as you are&mdash;why, 
so far so good.</p>
<p>Donne, who reports himself as very well (always living by 
Discipline and Rule), tells me that he has begged you to return 
to England if you would make sure of seeing him again.&nbsp; I 
told Pollock of your great Interest in Macready: I too find that 
I am <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>content to have bought the Book, and
feel more interest in the Man than in the Actor.&nbsp; My Mother 
used to know him once: but I never saw him in private till once 
at Pollock&rsquo;s after his retirement: when he sat quite quiet,
and (as you say) I was sorry not to have made a little Advance to
him, as I heard he had a little wished to see me because of that 
old Acquaintance with my Mother.&nbsp; I should like to have told
him how much I liked much of his Performance; asked him why he 
would say &lsquo;Amen stu-u-u-u-ck in my Throat&rsquo; (which was
a bit of wrong, as well as vulgar, Judgment, I think).&nbsp; But 
I looked on him as the great Man of the Evening, unpresuming as 
he was: and so kept aloof, as I have ever done from all 
Celebrities&mdash;yourself among them&mdash;who I thought must be
wearied enough of Followers and Devotees&mdash;unless those of 
Note.</p>
<p>I am now writing in the place&mdash;in the room&mdash;from 
which I wrote ten years ago&mdash;it all recurs to me&mdash;with 
Montaigne for my Company, and my Lugger about to be built.&nbsp; 
Now I have brought Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; (who loved 
Montaigne too&mdash;the capital Woman!) and the Lugger&mdash;Ah, 
there is a long sad Story about that!&mdash;which I won&rsquo;t 
go into&mdash;</p>
<p>Little Quaritch seems to have dropt Agamemnon, Lord of Hosts, 
for the present: and I certainly am not sorry, for I think it 
would only have been abused by English Critics: with some, but 
not all, Justice.&nbsp; You are very good in naming your American
Publisher, but I suppose it must be left at present with 
Quaritch, <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span

<p style="text-align: right">[<span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>, <i>April</i>, 1876.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>From Lowestoft still I date: as just ten years ago when I was 
about building a Lugger, and reading Montaigne.&nbsp; The latter 
holds his own with me after three hundred years: and the Lugger 
does not seem much the worse for her ten years&rsquo; wear, so 
well did she come bouncing between the Piers here yesterday, 
under a strong Sou&rsquo;-Wester.&nbsp; My Great Captain has her 
no more; he has what they call a &lsquo;Scotch Keel&rsquo; which 
is come into fashion: her too I see: and him too steering her, 
broader and taller than all the rest: fit to be a Leader of Men, 
Body and Soul; looking now Ulysses-like.&nbsp; Two or three years
ago he had a run of constant bad luck; and, being always of a 
grand convivial turn, treating Everybody, he got deep in Drink, 
against all his Promises to me, and altogether so lawless, that I
brought things to a pass between us.&nbsp; &lsquo;He should go on
with me if he would take the Tee-total Pledge for one 
year&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No&mdash;he had broken his word,&rsquo; 
he said, &lsquo;and he would not pledge it again,&rsquo; much as 
he wished to go on with me.&nbsp; That, you see, was very fine in
him; he is altogether fine&mdash;A <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Great Man, 
I maintain it: like one of Carlyle&rsquo;s old Norway Kings, with
a wider morality than we use; which is very good and fine (as 
this Captain said to me) &lsquo;for you who are born with a 
silver spoon in your mouths.&rsquo;&nbsp; I did not forget what 
Carlyle too says about Great Faults in Great Men: even in David, 
the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed.&nbsp; But I thought best to share the 
Property with him and let him go his way.&nbsp; He had always 
resented being under any Control, and was very glad to be his own
sole Master again: and yet clung to me in a wild and pathetic 
way.&nbsp; He has not been doing better since: and I fear is 
sinking into disorder.</p>
<p>This is a long story about one you know nothing about except 
what little I have told you.&nbsp; But the Man is a very 
remarkable Man indeed, and you may be interested&mdash;you must 
be&mdash;in him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho! parlons d&rsquo;autres choses, ma Fille,&rsquo; as 
my dear S&eacute;vign&eacute; says.&nbsp; She now occupies 
Montaigne&rsquo;s place in my room: well&mdash;worthily: she 
herself a Lover of Montaigne, and with a spice of his free 
thought and speech in her.&nbsp; I am sometimes vext I never made
her acquaintance till last year: but perhaps it was as well to 
have such an acquaintance reserved for one&rsquo;s latter 
years.&nbsp; The fine Creature! much more alive to me than most 
Friends&mdash;I <i>should</i> like to see her 
&lsquo;Rochers&rsquo; in Brittany. <a name="citation105"></a><a

<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&lsquo;Parlons d&rsquo;autres choses&rsquo;&mdash;your 
Mother&rsquo;s Miniature.&nbsp; You seemed at first to think it 
was taken from the Engraving: but the reverse was always clear to
me.&nbsp; The whole figure, down to the Feet, is wanted to 
account for the position of the Legs; and the superior delicacy 
of Feature would not be gained <i>from</i> the Engraving, but the
contrary.&nbsp; The Stars were stuck in to make an 
&lsquo;Urania&rsquo; of it perhaps.&nbsp; I do not assert that 
your Miniature is the original: but that such a Miniature 
is.&nbsp; I did not expect that Black next the Picture would do: 
had you &lsquo;tried on the Bonnet&rsquo; first, as I 
advised?&nbsp; I now wish I had sent the Picture over in its 
original Frame, which I had doctored quite well with a strip of 
Black Paper pasted over the Gold.&nbsp; It might really have gone
through Quaritch&rsquo;s Agency: but I got into my head that the 
Post was safer.&nbsp; (How badly I am writing!)&nbsp; I had a 
little common Engraving of the Cottage bonnet Portrait: so like 
Henry.&nbsp; If I did not send it to you, I know not what is 
become of it.</p>
<p>Along with your Letter came one from Donne telling me of your 
Niece&rsquo;s Death. <a name="citation106"></a><a 
href="#footnote106" class="citation">[106]</a>&nbsp; He said he 
had written to tell you.&nbsp; In reply, I gave him your message;
that he must &lsquo;hold on&rsquo; till next year when 
peradventure you may see England again, and hope to see him 
too.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>Sooner or later you will see an Account of &lsquo;Mary 
Tudor&rsquo; at the Lyceum. <a name="citation107"></a><a 
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; It is just 
what I expected: a &lsquo;succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime,&rsquo; 
and not a very enthusiastic one.&nbsp; Surely, no one could have 
expected more.&nbsp; And now comes out a new Italian 
Hamlet&mdash;Rossi&mdash;whose first appearance is recorded in 
the enclosed scrap of <i>Standard</i>.&nbsp; And (to finish 
Theatrical or Dramatic Business) Quaritch has begun to print 
Agamemnon&mdash;so leisurely that I fancy he wishes to wait till 
the old Persian is exhausted, and so join the two.&nbsp; I 
certainly am in no hurry; for I fully believe we shall only get 
abused for the Greek in proportion as we were praised for the 
Persian&mdash;in England.&nbsp; I mean: for you have made America
more favourable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Parlons d&rsquo;autres choses.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Eh? 
mais de quoi parler,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; Well: a Blackbird is 
singing in the little Garden outside my Lodging Window, which is 
frankly opened to what Sun there is.&nbsp; It has been a singular
half year; only yesterday Thunder in rather cold weather; and 
last week the Road and Rail in Cambridge and Huntingdon was 
blocked up with Snow; and Thunder then also.&nbsp; I suppose I 
shall get home in ten days: before this Letter will reach you, I 
suppose: so your next may be addressed to Woodbridge.&nbsp; I 
really don&rsquo;t know if these long Letters are more of Trouble
or Pleasure to you: however, there is an end to all: and that End
is that I am yours as truly as ever I was</p>

class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>July</i> 4, [1876.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Here I am back into the Country, as I may call my suburb here 
as compared to Lowestoft; all my house, except the one 
room&mdash;which &lsquo;serves me for Parlour and Bedroom and 
all&rsquo; <a name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a" 
class="citation">[108a]</a>&mdash;occupied by Nieces.&nbsp; Our 
weather is temperate, our Trees green, Roses about to bloom, 
Birds about to leave off singing&mdash;all sufficiently 
pleasant.&nbsp; I must not forget a Box from Mudie with some 
Memoirs in it&mdash;of Godwin, Haydon, etc., which help to amuse 
one.&nbsp; And I am just beginning Don Quixote once more for my 
&lsquo;pi&egrave;ce de R&eacute;sistance,&rsquo; not being so 
familiar with the First Part as the Second.&nbsp; Lamb and 
Coleridge (I think) thought that Second Part should not have been
written; why then did I&mdash;not for contradiction&rsquo;s sake,
I am sure&mdash;so much prefer it?&nbsp; Old Hallam, in his 
History of Literature, resolved me, I believe, by saying that 
Cervantes, who began by making his Hero ludicrously crazy, fell 
in love with him, and in the second part tamed and tempered him 
down to the grand Gentleman he is: scarce ever originating a 
Delusion, though acting his part in it as a true Knight when led 
into it by others. <a name="citation108b"></a><a 
href="#footnote108b" class="citation">[108b]</a>&nbsp; A good 
deal however might well be left out.&nbsp; If you have 
Jarvis&rsquo; Translation by, or near, <!-- page 109--><a 
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>you, pray 
read&mdash;oh, read all of the second part, except the stupid 
stuff of the old Duenna in the Duke&rsquo;s Palace.</p>
<p>I fear I get more and more interested in your 
&lsquo;Gossip,&rsquo; as you approach the Theatre.&nbsp; I 
suppose indeed that it is better to look on than to be engaged 
in.&nbsp; I love it, and reading of it, now as much as ever I 
cared to see it: and that was, very much indeed.&nbsp; I never 
heard till from your last Paper <a name="citation109a"></a><a 
href="#footnote109a" class="citation">[109a]</a> that Henry was 
ever thought of for Romeo: I wonder he did not tell me this when 
he and I were in Paris in 1830, and used to go and see 
&lsquo;L&#257; Muette!&rsquo; (I can hear them calling it now:) 
at the Grand Opera.&nbsp; I see that &lsquo;Queen Mary&rsquo; has
some while since been deposed from the Lyceum; and poor Mr. 
Irving descended from Shakespeare to his old Melodrama 
again.&nbsp; All this is still interesting to me down here: much 
more than to you&mdash;over there!&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Over there&rsquo; you are in the thick of your 
Philadelphian Exhibition, <a name="citation109b"></a><a 
href="#footnote109b" class="citation">[109b]</a> I suppose: but I
dare say you do not meddle with it very much, and will probably 
be glad when it is all over.&nbsp; I wish now I had sent you the 
Miniature in its Frame, which I had instructed to become 
it.&nbsp; What you tell us your Mother said concerning Dress, I 
certainly always felt: only secure the Beautiful, and the Grand, 
in all the Arts, whatever Chronology may say.&nbsp; Rousseau 
somewhere says that what you want of Decoration in the Theatre 
is, what <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>will bewilder the 
Imagination&mdash;&lsquo;&eacute;branler 
l&rsquo;Imagination,&rsquo; I think: <a name="citation110"></a><a

Beautiful!</p>

<p>I kept this letter open in case I should see Arthur Malkin, 
who was coming to stay at a Neighbour&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He 
very kindly did call on me: he and his second wife (who, my 
Neighbour says, is a very proper Wife), but I was 
abroad&mdash;though no further off than my own little Estate; and
he knows I do not visit elsewhere.&nbsp; But I do not the less 
thank him, and am always yours</p>

to tell you; so that [at] any rate your Eyes shall not be 
afflicted as sometimes I doubt they are by my MS.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Which MS. puts me at once in mind of Print: and to tell
you that I shall send you Quaritch&rsquo;s Reprint of Agamemnon: 
which is just done after many blunders.&nbsp; The revises were 
not sent me, as I desired: so several things are left as I meant 
not: but &lsquo;enfin&rsquo; here it is at last so fine that I am
ashamed of it.&nbsp; For, whatever the merit of it may be, it 
can&rsquo;t come near all this fine Paper, Margin, etc., which 
Quaritch <i>will</i> have as counting on only a few buyers, who 
will buy&mdash;in America almost wholly, I think.&nbsp; And, as 
this is wholly due to you, I send you the Reprint, however little
different to what you had before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tragedy wonders at being so fine,&rsquo; which leads me
to that which ought more properly to have led to <i>it</i>: your 
last two Papers of &lsquo;Gossip,&rsquo; which are capital, both 
for the Story told, and the remarks that arise from it.&nbsp; 
To-morrow, or next day, I shall have a new Number; and I really 
do count rather childishly on their arrival.&nbsp; Spedding also 
is going over some of his old Bacon ground in the Contemporary, 
<a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111" 
class="citation">[111]</a> and his writing is always delightful 
to me though I cannot agree with him at last.&nbsp; I am told he 
is in full Vigour: as indeed I might guess from his 
writing.&nbsp; I heard from Donne some three weeks ago: proposing
a Summer Holyday at Whitby, in Yorkshire: Valentia, I think, not 
very well again: Blanche then with her Brother Charles.&nbsp; 
They all speak very highly of Mrs. Santley&rsquo;s kindness and 
care.&nbsp; Mowbray talks <!-- page 112--><a

down this way toward the end of August: but had not, when he last
wrote, fixed on his Holyday place.</p>
<p>Beside my two yearly elder Nieces, I have now a younger who 
has spent the last five Winters in Florence with your once rather
intimate (I think) Jane FitzGerald my Sister.&nbsp; She married, 
(you may know) a Clergyman considerably older than herself.&nbsp;
I wrote to Annie Thackeray lately, and had an answer (from the 
Lakes) to say she was pretty well&mdash;as also Mr. Stephen.</p>

<p>Have your American Woods begun to hang out their Purple and 
Gold yet? on this Day of Equinox.&nbsp; Some of ours begin to 
look rusty, after the Summer Drought; but have not turned Yellow 
yet.&nbsp; I was talking of this to a Heroine of mine who lives 
near here, but visits the Highlands of Scotland, which she loves 
better than Suffolk&mdash;and she said of those <!-- page 
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

dying Airs, but turn Orange in a Day, and are swept off in a 
Whirlwind, and Winter is come.&rsquo;</p>

years&mdash;he looked much the same, except for his fallen Locks;
and what really surprised me was, that we fell at once into the 
old Humour, as if we had only been parted twenty Days instead of 
so many Years.&nbsp; I suppose this is a Sign of Age&mdash;not 
altogether desirable.&nbsp; But so it was.&nbsp; He stayed two 
Days, and we went over the same old grounds of Debate, told some 
of the old Stories, and all was well.&nbsp; I suppose I may never
see him again: and so I suppose we both thought as the Rail 
carried him off: and each returned to his ways as if scarcely

Hallam much; unaffected, unpretending&mdash;no Slang&mdash;none 
of Young England&rsquo;s nonchalance&mdash;speaking of his Father
as &lsquo;Papa&rsquo; and tending him with great Care, Love, and 
Discretion.&nbsp; Mrs. A. T. is much out of health, and scarce 
leaves Home, I think. <a name="citation114a"></a><a

<p>I have lately finished Don Quixote again, and I think have 
inflamed A. T. to read him too&mdash;I mean in his native 
Language.&nbsp; For this <i>must</i> be, good as Jarvis&rsquo; 
Translation is, and the matter of the Book so good that one would
think it would lose less than any Book by Translation.&nbsp; But 
somehow that is not so.&nbsp; I was astonished lately to see how 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry IV. came out in young V. Hugo&rsquo;s 
Prose Translation <a name="citation114b"></a><a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Little&mdash;Nothing&mdash;as I have to write, I am 
nevertheless beginning to write to you, from this old Lodging of 
mine, from which I think our Correspondence chiefly 
began&mdash;ten years ago.&nbsp; I am in the same Room: the same 
dull Sea moaning before me: the same Wind screaming through the 
Windows: so I take up the same old Story.&nbsp; My Lugger was 
then about building: <a name="citation115"></a><a 
href="#footnote115" class="citation">[115]</a> she has passed 
into other hands now: I see her from time to time bouncing into 
Harbour, with her &lsquo;244&rsquo; on her Bows.&nbsp; Her 
Captain and I have parted: I thought he did very 
wrongly&mdash;Drink, among other things: but he did not think he 
did wrong: a different Morality from ours&mdash;that, indeed, of 
Carlyle&rsquo;s ancient Sea Kings.&nbsp; I saw him a few days ago
in his house, with Wife and Children; looking, as always, too big
for his house: but always grand, polite, and unlike anybody 
else.&nbsp; I was noticing the many Flies in the 
room&mdash;&lsquo;Poor things,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it is the 
warmth of our Stove makes them alive.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Tennyson 
was with me, whose Portrait hangs <!-- page 116--><a 
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>in my house
in company with those of Thackeray and this Man (the three 
greatest men I have known), I thought that both Tennyson and 
Thackeray were inferior to him in respect of Thinking of 
Themselves.&nbsp; When Tennyson was telling me of how The 
Quarterly abused him (humorously too), and desirous of knowing 
why one did not care for his later works, etc., I thought that if
he had lived an active Life, as Scott and Shakespeare; or even 
ridden, shot, drunk, and played the Devil, as Byron, he would 
have done much more, and talked about it much less.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You know,&rsquo; said Scott to Lockhart, &lsquo;that I 
don&rsquo;t care a Curse about what I write,&rsquo; <a 
name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116" 
class="citation">[116]</a> and one sees he did not.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t believe it was far otherwise with Shakespeare.&nbsp; 
Even old Wordsworth, wrapt up in his Mountain mists, and proud as
he was, was above all this vain Disquietude: proud, not vain, was
he: and that a Great Man (as Dante) has some right to 
be&mdash;but not to care what the Coteries say.&nbsp; What a 
Rigmarole!</p>
<p>Donne scarce ever writes to me (Twalmley the Great), and if he
do not write to you, depend upon it he thinks he has nothing 
worth sending over the Atlantic.&nbsp; I heard from Mowbray quite
lately that his Father was very well.</p>
<p>Yes: you told me in a previous Letter that you were coming to 
England after Christmas.&nbsp; I shall not be up to going to 
London to see you, with all your Company about you; perhaps 
(don&rsquo;t think me <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>very impudent!) you may come down, 
if we live till Summer, to my Woodbridge Ch&acirc;teau, and there
talk over some old things.</p>
<p>I make a kind of Summer in my Room here with Boccaccio.&nbsp; 
What a Mercy that one can return with a Relish to these 
Books!&nbsp; As Don Quixote can only be read in his Spanish, so I
do fancy Boccaccio only in his Italian: and yet one is used to 
fancy that Poetry is the mainly untranslateable thing.&nbsp; How 
prettily innocent are the Ladies, who, after telling very loose 
Stories, finish with &lsquo;E cos&igrave; Iddio faccia [noi] 
godere del nostro Amore, etc.,&rsquo; sometimes, 
<i>Domeneddio</i>, more affectionately. <a 
name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a" 
class="citation">[117a]</a></p>
<p>Anyhow, these Ladies are better than the accursed Eastern 
Question; <a name="citation117b"></a><a href="#footnote117b" 
class="citation">[117b]</a> of which I have determined to read, 
and, if possible, hear, no more till the one question be settled 
of Peace or War.&nbsp; If war, I am told I may lose some 
&pound;5000 in Russian Bankruptcy: but I can truly say I would 
give that, and more, to ensure Peace and Good Will among Men at

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>If you hold to your Intention of coming to Europe in January, 
this will be my last Letter over the Atlantic&mdash;till further 
Notice!&nbsp; I dare say you will send me a last Rejoinder under 
the same conditions.</p>
<p>I write, you see, from the Date of my last letter: but have 
been at home in the meanwhile.&nbsp; And am going home 
to-morrow&mdash;to arrange about Christmas Turkeys (God send we 
haven&rsquo;t all our fill of that, this Year!) and other such 
little matters pertaining to the Season&mdash;which, to myself, 
is always a very dull one.&nbsp; Why it happens that I so often 
write to you from here, I scarce know; only that one comes with 
few Books, perhaps, and the Sea somehow talks to one of old 
Things.&nbsp; I have ever my Edition of Crabbe&rsquo;s Tales of 
the Hall with me.&nbsp; How pretty is this&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In a small Cottage on the rising Ground<br 
/>
West of the Waves, and just beyond their Sound.&rsquo; <a 
name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118" 
class="citation">[118]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which reminds me also that one of the Books I have here is 
Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hours in a Library,&rsquo; really 
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>delightful reading, and, I think, really settling some 
Questions of Criticism, as one wants to be finally done in all 
Cases, so as to have no more about and about it.&nbsp; I think I 
could have suggested a little Alteration in the matter of this 
Crabbe, whom I probably am better up in than L. S., though I 
certainly could not write about it as he does.&nbsp; Also, one 
word about <i>Clarissa</i>.&nbsp; Almost all the rest of the two 
Volumes I accept as a Disciple. <a name="citation119a"></a><a 
href="#footnote119a" class="citation">[119a]</a></p>
<p>Another Book of the kind&mdash;Lowell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Among my 
Books,&rsquo; is excellent also: perhaps with more <i>Genius</i> 
than Stephen: but on the other hand not so temperate, judicious, 
or scholarly in <i>taste</i>.&nbsp; It was Professor Norton who 
sent me Lowell&rsquo;s Second Series; and, if you 
should&mdash;(as you inevitably will, though in danger of losing 
the Ship) answer this Letter, pray tell me if you know how 
Professor Norton is&mdash;in health, I mean.&nbsp; You told me he
was very delicate: and I am tempted to think he may be less well 
than usual, as he has not acknowledged the receipt of a Volume <a
name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b" 
class="citation">[119b]</a> I sent him with some of 
Wordsworth&rsquo;s Letters in it, which he had wished to 
see.&nbsp; The Volume did not need Acknowledgment absolutely: but
probably would not have been received without by so amiable and 
polite a Man, if he [were] not out of sorts.&nbsp; I should 
really be glad to hear that he has only forgotten, or neglected, 
to write.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s Ode <a name="citation120a"></a><a 
href="#footnote120a" class="citation">[120a]</a> in your last 
Magazine seemed to me full of fine Thought; but it wanted 
Wings.&nbsp; I mean it kept too much to one Level, though a high 
Level, for Lyric Poetry, as Ode is supposed to be: both in 
respect to Thought, and Metre.&nbsp; Even Wordsworth (least 
musical of men) changed his Flight to better purpose in his Ode 
to Immortality.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, Mr. Lowell&rsquo;s 
subject did not require, or admit, such Alternations.</p>
<p>Your last Gossip brought me back to London&mdash;but what

Defeat at the Theatre so bravely. <a name="citation120b"></a><a

he himself had been out to dine: and was none the worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Donne has sent me the Address on the cover of this 
Letter.&nbsp; I know you will write directly you hear from me; 
that is &lsquo;de rigueur&rsquo; with you; and, at any rate, you 
have your Voyage home to England to tell me of: and how you find 
yourself and all in the Old Country.&nbsp; I suppose you include 
my Old Ireland in it.&nbsp; Donne wrote that you were to be there
till this Month&rsquo;s end; that is drawing near; and, if that 
you do not protract your Visit, you will [be] very soon within 
sight of dear Donne himself, who, I hear from Mowbray, is very 
well.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Your last Gossip was very interesting to me.&nbsp; I 
see in it (but not in the most interesting part) <a 
name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a" 
class="citation">[122a]</a> that you write of a &lsquo;J. 
F.,&rsquo; who tells you of a Sister of hers having a fourth 
Child, etc.&nbsp; I fancy this must be a Jane FitzGerald telling 
you of her Sister Kerrich, who would have numbered about so many 
Children about that time&mdash;1831.&nbsp; Was it that 
Jane?&nbsp; I think you and she were rather together just 
then.&nbsp; After which she married herself to a Mr. 
Wilkinson&mdash;made him very Evangelical&mdash;and 
tiresome&mdash;and so they fed their Flock in a Suffolk village. 
<a name="citation122b"></a><a href="#footnote122b" 
class="citation">[122b]</a>&nbsp; And about fourteen or fifteen 
years ago he died: and she went off to live in 
Florence&mdash;rather a change from the Suffolk Village&mdash;and
there, I suppose, she will die when her Time comes.</p>
<p>Now you have read Harold, I suppose; and you shall tell me 
what you think of it.&nbsp; Pollock and Miladi think it has 
plenty of Action and Life: one of which Qualities I rather missed
in it.</p>
<p>Mr. Lowell sent me his Three Odes about Liberty, <!-- page 
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>Washington, etc.&nbsp; They seemed to me full of fine 
Thought, and in a lofty Strain: but wanting Variety both of Mood 
and Diction for Odes&mdash;which are supposed to mean things to 
be chanted.&nbsp; So I ventured to hint to him&mdash;Is he an 
angry man?&nbsp; But he wouldn&rsquo;t care, knowing of me only 
through amiable Mr. Norton, who knows me through you.&nbsp; I 
think <i>he</i> must be a very amiable, modest, man.&nbsp; And I 
am still yours always</p>

<i>March</i> 15, [1877.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>By this time you are, I suppose, at the Address you gave me, 
and which will now cover this Letter.&nbsp; You have seen Donne, 
and many Friends, perhaps&mdash;and perhaps you have not yet got 
to London at all.&nbsp; But you will in time.&nbsp; When you do, 
you will, I think, have your time more taken up than in 
America&mdash;with so many old Friends about you: so that I wish 
more and more you would not feel bound to answer my Letters, one 
by one; but I suppose you will.</p>
<p>What I liked so much in your February Atlantic <a 
name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123" 
class="citation">[123]</a> was all about Goethe and Portia: I 
think, <i>fine</i> writing, <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>in the 
plain sense of the word, and partly so because not 
&lsquo;fine&rsquo; in the other Sense.&nbsp; You can indeed spin 
out a long Sentence of complicated Thought very easily, and very 
clearly; a rare thing.&nbsp; As to Goethe, I made another Trial 
at Hayward&rsquo;s Prose Translation this winter, but failed, as 
before, to get on with it.&nbsp; I suppose there is a Screw loose
in me on that point, seeing what all thinking People think of 
it.&nbsp; I am sure I have honestly tried.&nbsp; As to Portia, I 
still think she ought not to have proved her 
&lsquo;Superiority&rsquo; by withholding that simple Secret on 
which her Husband&rsquo;s Peace and his Friend&rsquo;s Life 
depended.&nbsp; Your final phrase about her &lsquo;sinking into 
perfection&rsquo; is capital.&nbsp; Epigram&mdash;without 
Effort.</p>
<p>You wrote me that Portia was your <i>beau-ideal</i> of 
Womanhood <a name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a" 
class="citation">[124a]</a>&mdash;Query, of 
<i>Lady-hood</i>.&nbsp; For she had more than &pound;500 a year, 
which Becky Sharp thinks enough to be very virtuous on, and had 
not been tried.&nbsp; Would she have done Jeanie Deans&rsquo; 
work?&nbsp; She might, I believe: but was not tried.</p>
<p>I doubt all this will be rather a Bore to you: coming back to 
England to find all the old topics of Shakespeare, etc., much as 
you left them.&nbsp; You will hear wonderful things about 
Browning and Co.&mdash;Wagner&mdash;and H. Irving.&nbsp; In a 
late <span class="smcap">Temple Bar</span> magazine <a 
name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b" 
class="citation">[124b]</a> Lady Pollock says that her Idol 
Irving&rsquo;s Reading of Hood&rsquo;s Eugene Aram is such that 
any <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>one among his Audience who had a 
guilty secret in his Bosom &lsquo;must either tell it, or 
die.&rsquo;&nbsp; These are her words.</p>
<p>You see I still linger in this ugly place: having a very dear 
little Niece a little way off: a complete little 
&lsquo;Pocket-Muse&rsquo; I call her.&nbsp; One of the first 
Things she remembers is&mdash;<i>you</i>, in white Satin, and 
very handsome, she says, reading Twelfth Night at this very 
place.&nbsp; And I am</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I am disappointed at not finding any Gossip in the last 
Atlantic; <a name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b" 
class="citation">[125b]</a> the Editor told us at the end of last
Year that it was to be carried on through this: <!-- page 
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
126</span>perhaps you are not bound down to every month: but I 
hope the links are not to discontinue for long.</p>
<p>I did not mean in my last letter to allude again to myself and
Co. in recommending some omissions when you republish. <a 
name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126" 
class="citation">[126]</a>&nbsp; That&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, about 
myself&mdash;I was satisfied you would cut out, as we had agreed 
before.&nbsp; (N.B.&nbsp; No occasion to omit your kindly Notices
about my Family&mdash;nor my own Name among them, if you like: 
only not all about myself.)&nbsp; What I meant in my last Letter 
was, some of your earlier Letters&mdash;or parts of 
Letters&mdash;to H.&mdash;as some from Canterbury, I 
think&mdash;I fancy some part of your early Life might be 
condensed.&nbsp; But I will tell you, if you will allow me, when 
the time comes: and then you can but keep to your own plan, which
you have good reason to think better than mine&mdash;though I am 
very strong in Scissors and Paste: my &lsquo;Harp and 
Lute.&rsquo;&nbsp; Crabbe is under them now&mdash;as usual, once 
a Year.&nbsp; If one lived in London, or in any busy place, all 
this would not be perhaps: but it hurts nobody&mdash;unless you, 
who do hear too much about it.</p>
<p>Last night I made my Reader begin Dickens&rsquo; wonderful 
&lsquo;Great Expectations&rsquo;: not considered one of his best,
you know, but full of wonderful things, and even with a Plot 
which, I think, only needed less intricacy to be admirable.&nbsp;
I had only just read the Book myself: but I wanted to see what my
Reader <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>would make of it: and he was so 
interested that he re-interested me too.&nbsp; Here is another 
piece of Woodbridge Life.</p>
<p>Now, if when London is hot you should like to run down to this
Woodbridge, here will be my house at your Service after 
July.&nbsp; It may be so all this month: but a Nephew, Wife, and 
Babe did talk of a Fortnight&rsquo;s Visit: but have not talked 
of it since I returned a fortnight ago.&nbsp; June and July my 
Invalid Niece and her Sister occupy the House&mdash;not 
longer.&nbsp; Donne, and all who know me, know that I do not like
anyone to come out of their way to visit me: but, if they be 
coming this way, I am very glad to do my best for them.&nbsp; And
if any of them likes to occupy my house at any time, here it is 
at their Service&mdash;at yours, for as long as you will, except 
the times I have mentioned.&nbsp; I give up the house entirely 
except my one room, which serves for Parlour and Bed: and which I
really prefer, as it reminds me of the Cabin of my dear little 
Ship&mdash;mine no more.</p>
<p>Here is a long Story about very little.&nbsp; Woodbridge 
again.</p>
<p>A Letter from Mowbray Donne told me that you had removed to 
some house in&mdash;Connaught Place? <a 
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a" 
class="citation">[127a]</a>&mdash;but he did not name the 
number.</p>
<p>Valentia&rsquo;s wedding comes on: perhaps you will be of the 
Party. <a name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b" 
class="citation">[127b]</a>&nbsp; I think it would be one more of
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
128</span>Sorrow than of Gladness to me: but perhaps that may be 
the case with most Bridals.</p>
<p>It is very cold here: ice of nights: but my Tulips and 
Anemones hold up still: and Nightingales sing.&nbsp; Somehow, I 
don&rsquo;t care for those latter at Night.&nbsp; They ought to 
be in Bed like the rest of us.&nbsp; This seems talking for the 
sake of being singular: but I have always felt it, singular or 
not.</p>
<p>And I am yours always</p>

<p>I only write now on the express condition (which I understand 
you to accept) that you will not reply till you are in 
Switzerland.&nbsp; I mean, of course, within any reasonable 
time.&nbsp; Your last Letter is not a happy one *: but the record
of your first Memoir cannot fail to interest and touch me.</p>
<p>I surmise&mdash;for you do not say so&mdash;that you are alone
in London now: then, you must get away as soon as you can; and I 
shall be very glad to hear from yourself that you are in some 
green Swiss Valley, with a blue Lake before you, and snowy 
mountain above.</p>
<p>I must tell you that, my Nieces being here&mdash;good, pious, 
and tender, they are too&mdash;(but one of them an <!-- page 
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>Invalid, and the other devoted to attend her) they make
but little change in my own way of Life.&nbsp; They live by 
themselves, and I only see them now and then in the 
Garden&mdash;sometimes not five minutes in the Day.&nbsp; But 
then I am so long used to Solitude.&nbsp; And there is an end of 
that Chapter.</p>
<p>I have your Gossip bound up: the binder backed it with Black, 
which I don&rsquo;t like (it was his doing, not mine), but you 
say that your own only Suit is Sables now.&nbsp; I am going to 
lend it to a very admirable Lady who is going to our ugly 
Sea-side, with a sick Brother: only I have pasted over one 
column&mdash;<i>which</i>, I leave you to guess at.</p>
<p>I think I never told you&mdash;what is the fact, 
however&mdash;that I had wished to dedicate Agamemnon to you, but
thought I could not do so without my own name appended.&nbsp; 
Whereas, I could, very simply, as I saw afterwards when too 
late.&nbsp; If ever he is reprinted I shall (unless you forbid) 
do as I desired to do: for, if for no other reason, he would 
probably never have been published but for you.&nbsp; Perhaps he 
had better [have] remained in private Life so far as England is 
concerned.&nbsp; And so much for that grand Chapter.</p>
<p>I think it is an ill-omened Year: beside War (which I 
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> read about) so much Illness and 
Death&mdash;hereabout, at any rate.&nbsp; A Nephew of 
mine&mdash;a capital fellow&mdash;was pitched upon his head from 
a Gig a week ago, and we know not yet how far that head of his 
may recover itself.&nbsp; But, beside one&rsquo;s own <!-- page 
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
130</span>immediate Friends, I hear of Sickness and Death from 
further Quarters; and our Church Bell has been everlastingly 
importunate with its &ldquo;Toll-toll.&rdquo; But Farewell for 
the present: pray do as I ask you about writing: and believe me

<p>I knew the best thing I could do concerning the Book you 
wanted was to send your Enquiry to the Oracle itself:&mdash;whose
Reply I herewith enclose.</p>
<p>Last Evening I heard read Jeanie Deans&rsquo; Audience with 
Argyle, and then with the Queen.&nbsp; There I stop with the 
Book.&nbsp; Oh, how refreshing is the leisurely, easy, movement 
of the Story, with its true, and well-harmonized Variety of Scene
and Character!&nbsp; There is of course a 
Bore&mdash;Saddletree&mdash;as in Shakespeare.&nbsp; I presume to
think&mdash;as in Cervantes&mdash;as in Life itself: somewhat too
much of him in Scott, perhaps.&nbsp; But when the fuliginous and 
Spasmodic Carlyle <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>and Co. talk of Scott&rsquo;s 
delineating his Characters from without to within <a 
name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a" 
class="citation">[131a]</a>&mdash;why, he seems to have had a 
pretty good Staple of the inner Man of David, and Jeanie Deans, 
on beginning his Story; as of the Antiquary, Dalgetty, the 
Ashtons, and a lot more.&nbsp; I leave all but the Scotch 
Novels.&nbsp; Madge has a little&mdash;a wee bit&mdash;theatrical
about her: but I think her to be paired off with Ophelia, and 
worth all Miss Austen&rsquo;s Drawing-room Respectabilities put 
together.&nbsp; It is pretty what Barry Cornwall says on meeting 
Scott among other Authors at Rogers&rsquo;: &lsquo;I do not think
any one envied him any more than one envies Kings.&rsquo; <a 
name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"

your Gossip: as one ought to do in these latter Days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Edward FitzGerald</span>,</p>
<p>I have sent your book (&lsquo;Mrs. Kemble&rsquo;s 
Autobiography&rsquo;) as far as Bealings by a safe convoy, and my
cousin, Elizabeth Phillips, who is staying there, will ultimately
convey it to its destination at your house.</p>
<p>It afforded Charlotte [wife] and myself several evenings of 
very agreeable reading, and we certainly were impressed most 
favourably with new views as to the qualities of heart and head 
of the writer.&nbsp; Some observations were far beyond what her 
years would have led one to expect.&nbsp; I think some letters to
her friend &lsquo;S.&rsquo; on the strange fancy which hurried 
off her brother from taking orders, to fighting Spanish quarrels,
are very remarkable for their good sense, as well as warm 
feeling.&nbsp; Her energy too in accepting her profession at the 
age of twenty as a means of assisting her father to overcome his 
difficulties is indicative of the best form of 
genius&mdash;steady determination to an end.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, whilst reading the book, we met Mrs. Gordon 
(a daughter of Mrs. Sartoris) and her husband at Malkin&rsquo;s 
at dinner, and I had the pleasure of sitting next to her.&nbsp; 
The durability of type in the <!-- page 133--><a

might be a matter for observation with physiologists, and from 
the little I saw of her I should think the lady worthy of the 
family.</p>
<p>If the book be issued in a reprint a few omissions might be 
well.&nbsp; I fear we lost however by some lacun&aelig; which you
had caused by covering up a page or two.</p>

is a Lord&mdash;Ex-Chancellor&mdash;but a very good, amiable, and
judicious man.&nbsp; I should have sent you any other such 
testimony, had not all but this been oral, only this one took

there.&nbsp; You probably know about it; and will tell me?</p>

Love-Letters to Fanny Brawne.&nbsp; One wishes she had another 
name; and had left some other Likeness of herself than the 
Silhouette (cut out by Scissors, I fancy) which dashes 
one&rsquo;s notion of such a Poet&rsquo;s worship.&nbsp; But one

had&mdash;perhaps have&mdash;one of Alfred Tennyson, done by an 
Artist on a Steamboat&mdash;some thirty years ago; which, though 
not inaccurate of outline, gave one the idea of a respectable 
Apprentice. <a name="citation134c"></a><a href="#footnote134c"

Letters&mdash;It happened that, <!-- page 135--><a

they reached me, I had been hammering out some admirable Notes on
Catullus <a name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a" 
class="citation">[135a]</a>&mdash;another such fiery Soul who 
perished about thirty years of age two thousand years ago; and I 
scarce felt a change from one to other. <a

class="citation">[135b]</a>&nbsp; From Catullus&rsquo; better 
parts, I mean; for there is too much of filthy and 
odious&mdash;both of Love and Hate.&nbsp; Oh, my dear Virgil 
never fell into that: he was fit to be Dante&rsquo;s companion 
beyond even Purgatory.</p>
<p>I have just had a nice letter from Mr. Norton in America: an 
amiable, modest man surely he must be.&nbsp; His aged Mother has 
been ill: fallen indeed into some half-paralysis: affecting her 
Speech principally.&nbsp; He says nothing of Mr. Lowell; to whom 
I would write if I did not suppose he was very busy with his 
Diplomacy, and his Books, in Spain.&nbsp; I hope he will give us 
a Cervantes, in addition to the Studies in his &lsquo;Among my 
Books,&rsquo; which seem to me, on the whole, the most conclusive
Criticisms we have on their several subjects.</p>
<p>Do you ever see Mrs. Ritchie?&nbsp; Fred. Tennyson wrote me 
that Alfred&rsquo;s son (Lionel, the younger, I suppose) was to 
be married in Westminster Abbey: which Fred, thinks an ambitious 
flight of Mrs. A. T.</p>
<p>I may as well stop in such Gossip.&nbsp; Snowdrops and 
Crocuses out: I have not many, for what I had have been buried 
under an overcoat of Clay, poor <!-- page 136--><a

<i>April</i> 16, [1878.]</p>
<p>[Where, by the by, I heard the Nightingale for the first time 
yesterday Morning.&nbsp; That is, I believe, almost its exact 
date of return, wind and weather permitting.&nbsp; Which being 
premised&mdash;]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I think it is about the time for you to have a letter from me;
for I think I am nearly as punctual as the Nightingale, though at
quicker Intervals; and perhaps there may be other points of 
Unlikeness.&nbsp; After hearing that first Nightingale in my 
Garden, I found a long, kind, and pleasant, Letter from Mr. 
Lowell in Madrid: the first of him too that I have heard since he
flew thither.&nbsp; Just before he wrote, he says, he had been 
assigning Damages to some American who complained of having been 
fed too long on Turtle&rsquo;s Eggs <a name="citation136"></a><a 
href="#footnote136" class="citation">[136]</a>:&mdash;and all 
that sort of Business, says the Minister, does not inspire a man 
to Letter-writing.&nbsp; He is acclimatizing himself to 
Cervantes, about <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>whom he must write one of his fine, 
and (as I think) final Essays: I mean such as (in the case of 
others he has done) ought to leave no room for a reversal of 
Judgment.&nbsp; Amid the multitude of Essays, Reviews, etc., one 
still wants <i>that</i>: and I think Lowell does it more than any
other Englishman.&nbsp; He says he meets Velasquez at every turn 
of the street; and Murillo&rsquo;s Santa Anna opens his door for 
him.&nbsp; Things are different here: but when my Oracle last 
night was reading to me of Dandie Dinmont&rsquo;s blessed visit 
to Bertram in Portanferry Gaol, I said&mdash;&lsquo;I know 
it&rsquo;s Dandie, and I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprized to 
see him come into this room.&rsquo;&nbsp; No&mdash;no more 
than&mdash;Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;!&nbsp; I suppose it is
scarce right to live so among Shadows; but&mdash;after near 
seventy years so passed&mdash;&lsquo;Que voulez-vous?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still, if any Reality would&mdash;of its own 
Volition&mdash;draw near to my still quite substantial Self; I 
say that my House (if the Spring do not prove unkindly) will be 
ready to receive&mdash;and the owner also&mdash;any time before 
June, and after July; that is, before Mrs. Kemble goes to the 
Mountains, and after she returns from them.&nbsp; I dare say no 
more, after so much so often said, and all about oneself.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Nightingale; and To-day a small, still, Rain 
which we had hoped for, to make &lsquo;poindre&rsquo; the 
Flower-seeds we put in Earth last Saturday.&nbsp; All Sunday my 
white Pigeons were employed in confiscating the Sweet Peas we had
laid there; so that To-day we have to sow the same anew.</p>

don&rsquo;t say the best, but only to myself the most acceptable

the moral French type (I suppose some of the Shadow is left out 
of the Sketch), but of a Soul quite abhorrent from modern French 
Literature&mdash;from V. Hugo (I think) to E. Sue (I am 
sure).&nbsp; He loves to read&mdash;Clarissa! which reminded me 
of Tennyson, some forty years ago, saying to me <i>&agrave;

M. a Sister of the Bon Secours attended him: and, when she left, 
gave him a Pen worked in coloured Silks, &lsquo;Pensez &agrave;

had knitted.&nbsp; Seventeen years (I think) after, when his last

<i>August</i> 24, [1878.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I forget if I wrote to you from this solitary Seaside, last 
year: telling you of its old Priory walls, etc.&nbsp; I think you
must have been in Switzerland when I <!-- page 139--><a 
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>was here; 
however, I&rsquo;ll not tell you the little there is to tell 
about it now; for, beside that I may have told it all before, 
this little lodging furnishes only a steel pen, and very diluted 
ink (as you see), and so, for your own sake, I will be 
brief.&nbsp; Indeed, my chief object in writing at all, is, to 
ask when you go abroad, and how you have done at Malvern since 
last I heard from you&mdash;now a month ago, I think.</p>
<p>About the beginning of next week I shall be leaving this 
place&mdash;for good, I suppose&mdash;for the two 
friends&mdash;Man and Wife&mdash;who form my Company here, living
a long musket shot off, go away&mdash;he in broken 
health&mdash;and would leave the place too solitary without 
them.&nbsp; So I suppose I shall decamp along with them; and, 
after some time spent at Lowestoft, find my way back to 
Woodbridge&mdash;in time to see the End of the Flowers, and to 
prepare what is to be done in that way for another Year.</p>
<p>And to Woodbridge your Answer may be directed, if this poor 
Letter of mine reaches you, and you should care to answer 
it&mdash;as you will&mdash;oh yes, you will&mdash;were it much 
less significant.</p>
<p>I have been rather at a loss for Books while here, Mudie 
having sent me a lot I did not care for&mdash;not even for Lady 
Chatterton.&nbsp; Aldis Wright gave me his Edition of Coriolanus 
to read; and I did not think &lsquo;<i>pow wow</i>&rsquo; of it, 
as Volumnia says.&nbsp; All the people were talking about me.</p>

class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>: <i>April</i> 3/79.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>I know well how exact you are in answering Letters; and I was 
afraid that you must be in some trouble, for yourself, or others,
when I got no reply to a second Letter I wrote you addressed to 
Baltimore Hotel, Leamington&mdash;oh, two months ago.&nbsp; When 
you last wrote to me, you were there, with a Cough, which you 
were just going to take with you to Guy&rsquo;s Cliff.&nbsp; That
I thought not very prudent, in the weather we then had.&nbsp; 
Then I was told by some one, in a letter (not from any Donne, I 
think&mdash;no, Annie Ritchie, I believe) that Mrs. Sartoris was 
very ill; and so between two probable troubles, I would not 
trouble you as yet again.&nbsp; I had to go to London for a day 
three weeks ago (to see a poor fellow dying, sooner or later, of 
Brain disease), and I ferreted out Mowbray Donne from Somerset 
House and he told me you were in London, still ill of a Cough; 
but not your Address.&nbsp; So I wrote to his Wife a few days ago
to learn it; and I shall address this Letter accordingly.&nbsp; 
Mrs. Mowbray writes that you are better, but obliged to take care
of yourself.&nbsp; I can only say &lsquo;do not trouble yourself 
to write&rsquo;&mdash;but I suppose you will&mdash;perhaps the 
more if it be a trouble.&nbsp; See what an Opinion I have of 
you!&mdash;If you write, <!-- page 141--><a 
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>pray tell 
me of Mrs. Sartoris&mdash;and do not forget yourself.</p>
<p>It has been such a mortal Winter among those I know, or know 
of, as I never remember.&nbsp; I have not suffered myself, 
further than, I think, feeling a few stronger hints of a 
constitutional sort, which are, I suppose, to assert themselves 
ever more till they do for me.&nbsp; And that, I suppose, cannot 
be long adoing.&nbsp; I entered on my 71st year last Monday, 
March 31.</p>
<p>My elder&mdash;and now only&mdash;Brother, John, has been shut
up with Doctor and Nurse these two months&mdash;&AElig;t. 76; his
Wife &AElig;t. 80 all but dead awhile ago, now sufficiently 
recovered to keep her room in tolerable ease: I do not know if my
Brother will ever leave his house.</p>
<p>Oh dear!&nbsp; Here is enough of Mortality.</p>
<p>I see your capital Book is in its third Edition, as well it 
deserves to be.&nbsp; I <i>see</i> no one with whom to talk about
it, except one brave Woman who comes over here at rare 
intervals&mdash;she had read my Atlantic Copy, but must get 
Bentley&rsquo;s directly it appeared, and she (a woman of 
remarkably strong and independent Judgment) loves it 
all&mdash;not (as some you know) wishing some of it away.&nbsp; 
No; she says she wants all to complete her notion of the 
writer.&nbsp; Nor have I <i>heard</i> of any one who thinks 
otherwise: so &lsquo;some people&rsquo; may be wrong.&nbsp; I 
know you do not care about all this.</p>
<p>I am getting my &lsquo;Tales of the Hall&rsquo; printed, and 
shall one day ask you, and three or four beside, <!-- page 
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>whether it had better be published.&nbsp; I think you, 
and those three or four others, will like it; but they may also 
judge that indifferent readers might not.&nbsp; And that you will
all of you have to tell me when the thing is done.&nbsp; I shall 
not be in the least disappointed if you tell me to keep it among 
&lsquo;ourselves,&rsquo; so long as &lsquo;ourselves&rsquo; are 
pleased; for I know well that Publication would not carry it much
further abroad; and I am very well content to pay my money for 
the little work which I have long meditated doing.&nbsp; I shall 
have done &lsquo;my little owl.&rsquo;&nbsp; Do you know what 
that means?&mdash;No.&nbsp; Well then; my Grandfather had several
Parrots of different sorts and Talents: one of them 
(&lsquo;Billy,&rsquo; I think) could only huff up his feathers in
what my Grandfather called an owl fashion; so when Company were 
praising the more gifted Parrots, he would say&mdash;&lsquo;You 
will hurt poor Billy&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;Come!&nbsp; Do your 
little owl, my dear!&rsquo;&mdash;You are to imagine a handsome, 
hair-powdered, Gentleman doing this&mdash;and his 
Daughter&mdash;my Mother&mdash;telling of it.</p>
<p>And so it is I do my little owl.</p>
<p>This little folly takes a long bit of my Letter 
paper&mdash;and I do not know that you will see any fun in 
it.&nbsp; Like my Book, it would not tell in Public.</p>
<p>Spedding reads my proofs&mdash;for, though I have confidence 
in my Selection of the Verse (owl), I have but little in my 
interpolated Prose, which I make obscure in trying to make 
short.&nbsp; Spedding <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>occasionally marks a blunder; but 
(confound him!) generally leaves me to correct it.</p>
<p>Come&mdash;here is more than enough of my little owl.&nbsp; At
night we read Sir Walter for an Hour (Montrose just now) by way 
of &lsquo;Play&rsquo;&mdash;then &lsquo;ten minutes&rsquo; 
refreshment allowed&rsquo;&mdash;and the Curtain rises on Dickens
(Copperfield now) which sends me gaily to bed&mdash;after one 
Pipe of solitary Meditation&mdash;in which 
the&mdash;&lsquo;little owl,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>By the way, in talking of Plays&mdash;after sitting with my 
poor friend and his brave little Wife till it was time for him to
turn bedward&mdash;I looked in at the famous Lyceum Hamlet; and 
soon had looked, and heard enough.&nbsp; It was incomparably the 
worst I had ever witnessed, from Covent Garden down to a Country 
Barn.&nbsp; I should scarce say this to you if I thought you had 
seen it; for you told me you thought Irving might have been even 
a great Actor, from what you saw of his Louis XI. I think.&nbsp; 
When he got to &lsquo;Something too much of this,&rsquo; I called
out from the Pit door where I stood, &lsquo;A good deal too 
much,&rsquo; and not long after returned to my solitary 
inn.&nbsp; Here is a very long&mdash;and, I believe (as owls go) 
a rather pleasant Letter.&nbsp; You know you are not bound to 
repay it in length, even if you answer it at all; which I again 
vainly ask you not to do if a bore.</p>
<p>I hear from Mrs. Mowbray that our dear Donne is but 
&lsquo;pretty well&rsquo;; and I am still yours</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I think I have let sufficient time elapse before asking you 
for another Letter.&nbsp; I want to know how you are: and, if you
can tell me that you are as well as you and I now expect to 
be&mdash;anyhow, well rid of that Whooping Cough&mdash;that will 
be news enough for one Letter.&nbsp; What else, you shall add of 
your own free will:&mdash;not feeling bound.</p>
<p>When you last wrote me from Leamington, you crossed over your 
Address: and I (thinking perhaps of America) deciphered it 
&lsquo;Baltimore.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wonder the P. O. did not return 
me my Letter: but there was no Treason in it, I dare say.</p>
<p>My Brother keeps waiting&mdash;and 
hoping&mdash;for&mdash;Death: which will not come: perhaps 
Providence would have let it come sooner, were he not rich enough
to keep a Doctor in the house, to keep him in Misery.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t know if I told you in my last that he was ill; seized
on by a Disease not uncommon to old Men&mdash;an &lsquo;internal 
Disorder&rsquo; it is polite to say; but I shall say to you, 
disease of the Bladder.&nbsp; I had always supposed he would be 
found dead one good morning, as my Mother was&mdash;as I hoped to
be&mdash;quietly dead of the Heart which he had felt for several 
Years.&nbsp; But no; it is seen good that he shall be laid on the
Rack&mdash;which he may <!-- page 145--><a 
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>feel the 
more keenly as he never suffered Pain before, and is not of a 
strong Nerve.&nbsp; I will say no more of this.&nbsp; The funeral
Bell, which has been at work, as I never remember before, all 
this winter, is even now, as I write, tolling from St. 
Mary&rsquo;s Steeple.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Parlons d&rsquo;autres choses,&rsquo; as my dear 
S&eacute;vign&eacute; says.</p>
<p>I&mdash;We&mdash;have finished all Sir Walter&rsquo;s Scotch 
Novels; and I thought I would try an English one: 
Kenilworth&mdash;a wonderful Drama, which Theatre, Opera, and 
Ballet (as I once saw it represented) may well reproduce.&nbsp; 
The Scene at Greenwich, where Elizabeth &lsquo;interviews&rsquo; 
Sussex and Leicester, seemed to me as fine as what is called (I 
am told, wrongly) Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry VIII. <a 
name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145" 
class="citation">[145]</a>&nbsp; Of course, plenty of melodrama 
in most other parts:&mdash;but the Plot wonderful.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;after Sir Walter&mdash;Dickens&rsquo; Copperfield, 
which came to an end last night because I would not let my Reader
read the last Chapter.&nbsp; What a touch when Peggotty&mdash;the
man&mdash;at last finds the lost Girl, and&mdash;throws a 
handkerchief over her face when he takes her to his 
arms&mdash;never to leave her!&nbsp; I maintain it&mdash;a little
Shakespeare&mdash;a Cockney Shakespeare, if you will: but as 
distinct, if not so great, a piece of pure Genius as was born in 
Stratford.&nbsp; Oh, I am quite sure of that, had I to choose but
one of them, I would choose Dickens&rsquo; hundred delightful 
Caricatures rather than Thackeray&rsquo;s half-dozen terrible 
Photographs.</p>

146</span>In Michael Kelly&rsquo;s Reminiscences <a

found that, on January 22, 1802, was produced at Drury Lane an 
Afterpiece called <i>Urania</i>, by the Honourable W. Spencer, in
which &lsquo;the scene of Urania&rsquo;s descent was entirely new
to the stage, and produced an extraordinary effect.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Hence then the Picture which my poor Brother sent you to 
America.</p>
<p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;autres choses encore.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may 
judge, I suppose, by the N.E. wind in London what it has been 
hereabout.&nbsp; Scarce a tinge of Green on the hedgerows; scarce
a Bird singing (only once the Nightingale, with broken Voice), 
and no flowers in the Garden but the brave old Daffydowndilly, 
and Hyacinth&mdash;which I scarce knew was so hardy.&nbsp; I am 
quite pleased to find how comfortably they do in my Garden, and 
look so Chinese gay.&nbsp; Two of my dear Blackbirds have I found
dead&mdash;of Cold and Hunger, I suppose; but one is even now 
singing&mdash;across that Funeral Bell.&nbsp; This is so, as I 
write, and tell you&mdash;Well: we have Sunshine at 
last&mdash;for a day&mdash;&lsquo;thankful for small 
Blessings,&rsquo; etc.</p>

<p>By this Post you ought to receive my Crabbe Book, about which 
I want your Opinion&mdash;not as to your own liking, which I 
doubt not will be more than it deserves: but about whether it is 
best confined to Friends, who will like it, as you do, more or 
less out of private prejudice&mdash;Two points in particular I 
want you to tell me;</p>
<p>(1) Whether the Stories generally seem to you to be curtailed 
so much that they do not leave any such impression as in the 
Original.&nbsp; That is too long and tiresome; but (as in 
Richardson) its very length serves to impress it on the 
mind:&mdash;My Abstract is, I doubt not, more readable: but, on 
that account partly, leaving but a wrack behind.&nbsp; What I 
have done indeed is little else than one of the old Review 
Articles, which gave a sketch of the work, and let the author 
fill in with his better work.</p>
<p>Well then I want to know&mdash;(2) if you find the present 
tense of my Prose Narrative discordant with the past tense of the
text.&nbsp; I adopted it partly by way of further discriminating 
the two: but I may have misjudged: Tell me: as well as any other 
points that strike you.&nbsp; You can tell me if you <!-- page 
148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
148</span>will&mdash;and I wish you would&mdash;whether I had 
better keep the little <i>Opus</i> to ourselves or let it take 
its chance of getting a few readers in public.&nbsp; You may tell
me this very plainly, I am sure; and I shall be quite as well 
pleased to keep it unpublished.&nbsp; It is only a very, very, 
little Job, you see: requiring only a little Taste, and Tact: and
if they have failed me&mdash;<i>Voil&agrave;</i>!&nbsp; I had 
some pleasure in doing my little work very dexterously, I 
thought; and I did wish to draw a few readers to one of my 
favourite Books which nobody reads.&nbsp; And, now that I look 
over it, I fancy that I may have missed my aim&mdash;only that my
Friends will like, etc.&nbsp; Then, I should have to put some 
Preface to the Public: and explain how many omissions, and some 
transpositions, have occasioned the change here and there of some
initial particle where two originally separated paragraphs are 
united; some use made of Crabbe&rsquo;s original MS. (quoted in 
the Son&rsquo;s Edition;) and all such confession to no good, 
either for my Author or me.&nbsp; I wish you could have just 
picked up the Book at a Railway Stall, knowing nothing of your 
old Friend&rsquo;s hand in it.&nbsp; But that cannot be; tell me 
then, divesting yourself of all personal Regard: and you may 
depend upon it you will&mdash;save me some further bother, if you
bid me let publishing alone.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even know of a

whether private or public&mdash;neither of which I 
intended&mdash;simply, Readings to oneself.&nbsp; I, who am a 
poor reader in any way, have found it all but impossible to read 
Crabbe to anybody.&nbsp; So much for that&mdash;except that, the 
Portrait I had prepared by way of frontispiece turns out to be an
utter failure, and that is another satisfactory reason for not 
publishing.&nbsp; For I particularly wanted this Portrait, copied
from a Picture by Pickersgill which was painted in 1817, when 
these Tales were a-writing, to correct the Phillips Portrait done
in the same year, and showing Crabbe with his company 
Look&mdash;not <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>insincere at all&mdash;but not at 
all representing the <i>writer</i>.&nbsp; When Tennyson saw 
Laurence&rsquo;s Copy of this Pickersgill&mdash;here, at my house
here&mdash;he said&mdash;&lsquo;There I recognise the 
Man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If you were not the truly sincere woman you are, I should have
thought that you threw in those good words about my other little 
Works by way of salve for your <i>dictum</i> on this 
Crabbe.&nbsp; But I know it is not so.&nbsp; I cannot think what 
&lsquo;rebuke&rsquo; I gave you to &lsquo;smart under&rsquo; as 
you say. <a name="citation151a"></a><a href="#footnote151a"

<p>If you have never read Charles Tennyson (Turner&rsquo;s) 
Sonnets, I should like to send them to you to read.&nbsp; They 
are not to be got now: and I have entreated Spedding to republish
them with Macmillan, with such a preface of his 
own&mdash;congenial Critic and Poet&mdash;as would discover these
Violets now modestly hidden under the rank Vegetation of 
Browning, Swinburne, and Co.&nbsp; Some of these Sonnets have a 
Shakespeare fancy in them:&mdash;some rather puerile&mdash;but 
the greater part of them, pure, delicate, beautiful, and quite 
original. <a name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b"

get them published over the water if no one will do so here.</p>
<p>Little did I think that I should ever come to relish&mdash;old
Sam Rogers!&nbsp; But on taking him up the other day (with 
Stothard&rsquo;s Designs, to be sure!) I found <!-- page 152--><a

Repose from the hatchet-work School, of which I read in the

<p>only the other night I could not help reverting to that

Hunt, who had saved himself by denouncing Thurtell&mdash;sending 
for him to pass the night before Execution with perfect

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:</p>
<p>Two or three days, I think, after receiving your last letter, 
I posted an answer addrest to the Poste <!-- page 153--><a

of&mdash;Lucerne, was it?&mdash;anyhow, the town whose name you 
gave me, and no more.&nbsp; Now, I will venture through Coutts, 
unwilling as I am to trouble their Highnesses&mdash;with whom my 
Family have banked for three&mdash;if not 
four&mdash;Generations.&nbsp; Otherwise, I do not think they 
would be troubled with my Accounts, which they attend to as 
punctually as if I were &lsquo;my Lord;&rsquo; and I am now their
last Customer of my family, I believe, though I doubt not they 
have several Dozens of my Name in their Books&mdash;for Better or
Worse.</p>
<p>What now spurs me to write is&mdash;an Article <a 
name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153" 
class="citation">[153]</a> I have seen in a Number of Macmillan 
for February, with very honourable mention of your Brother John 
in an Introductory Lecture on Anglo Saxon, by Professor 
Skeat.&nbsp; If you have not seen this &lsquo;Hurticle&rsquo; (as
Thackeray used to say) I should like to send it to you; and will 
so do, if you will but let me know where it may find you.</p>
<p>I have not been away from this place save for a Day or two 
since last you heard from me.&nbsp; In a fortnight I may be going
to Lowestoft along with my friends the Cowells.</p>
<p>I take great Pleasure in Hawthorne&rsquo;s 
Journals&mdash;English, French, and Italian&mdash;though I cannot
read his Novels.&nbsp; They are too thickly detailed for me: and 
of unpleasant matter too.&nbsp; We of the Old World beat the New,
I think, in a more easy manner; <!-- page 154--><a

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Your last letter told me that you were to be back in England 
by the middle of this month.&nbsp; So I write some lines to ask 
if you <i>are</i> back, and where to be found.&nbsp; To be sure, 
I can learn that much from some Donne: to the Father of whom I 
must commit this letter for any further Direction.&nbsp; But I 
will also say a little&mdash;very little having to 
say&mdash;beyond asking you how you are, and in what Spirits 
after the great Loss you have endured. <a 
name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154" 
class="citation">[154]</a></p>
<p>Of that Loss I heard from Blanche Donne&mdash;some while, it 
appears, before you heard of it yourself.&nbsp; I cannot say that
it was surprising, however sad, considering the terrible Illness 
she had some fifteen years ago.&nbsp; I will say no more of it, 
nor of her, of whom I could say so much; but nothing that would 
not be more than superfluous to you.</p>
<p>It did so happen, that, the day before I heard of her Death, I
had thought to myself that I would send her my Crabbe, as to my 
other friends, and wondered <!-- page 155--><a 
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>that I had 
not done so before.&nbsp; I should have sent off the Volume for 
Donne to transmit when&mdash;Blanche&rsquo;s Note came.</p>
<p>After writing of this, I do not think I should add much more, 
had I much else to write about.&nbsp; I will just say that I came
to this place five weeks ago to keep company with my friend 
Edward Cowell, the Professor; we read Don Quixote together in a 
morning and chatted for two or three hours of an evening; and now
he is gone away to Cambridge and [has] left me to my Nephews and 
Nieces here.&nbsp; By the month&rsquo;s end I shall be home at 
Woodbridge, whither any Letter you may please to write me may be 
addressed.</p>
<p>I try what I am told are the best Novels of some years back, 
but find I cannot read any but Trollope&rsquo;s.&nbsp; So now 
have recourse to Forster&rsquo;s Life of Dickens&mdash;a very 
good Book, I still think.&nbsp; Also, Eckermann&rsquo;s 
Goethe&mdash;almost as repeatedly to be read as Boswell&rsquo;s 
Johnson&mdash;a German Johnson&mdash;and (as with Boswell) more 
interesting to me in Eckermann&rsquo;s Diary than in all his own 
famous works.</p>

<p>I am daily&mdash;hourly&mdash;expecting to hear of the Death

<p>I was to have been at Woodbridge before this: and your Letter 
only reached me here yesterday.&nbsp; I have thought upon your 
desire to see me as an old Friend of yourself and yours; and you 
shall not have the trouble of saying so in vain.&nbsp; I should 
indeed be perplext at the idea of your coming all this way for 
such a purpose, to be shut up at an Hotel with no one to look in 
on you but myself (for you would not care for my Kindred 
here)&mdash;and my own Woodbridge House would require a little 
time to set in order, as I have for the present lost the services
of one of my &lsquo;helps&rsquo; there.&nbsp; What do you say to 
my going to London to see you instead of your coming down to see 
me?&nbsp; I should anyhow have to go to London soon; and I could 
make my going sooner, or as soon as you please.&nbsp; Not but, if
you want to get out of London, as well as to see me, I can surely
get my house right in a little time, and will gladly do so, 
should you prefer it.&nbsp; I hope, indeed, that you will not 
stay in London at this time of year, when so many friends are out
of it; and it has been my thought&mdash;and hope, I may 
say&mdash;that you have already betaken yourself to some pleasant
place, <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span

now keeps me from going at once to look for you in London, after

do, and moreover shall see a poor Lady who has just lost her 
husband, after nearly three years anxious and uncertain watching,
and now finds herself (brave and strong little Woman) somewhat

<p>When I got home yesterday, and emptied my Pockets, I found the
precious Enclosure which I had meant to show, and (if you 
pleased) to give you.&nbsp; A wretched Sketch (whether by me or 
another, I know not) of your Brother John in some Cambridge Room,
about the year 1832-3, when he and I were staying there, long 
after Degree time&mdash;he, studying Anglo-Saxon, I 
suppose&mdash;reading something, you see, with a glass of Ale on 
the table&mdash;or old Piano-forte was it?&mdash;to which he 
would sing very well his German Songs.&nbsp; Among them,</p>

our conversing together, face to face, in Queen Anne&rsquo;s <!--

told us of fifty years ago haunting the Flower-beds, <a

you last in London, I <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span

call; I had not reflected that by far the greater number of them 
could not be Old Friends; and those you cling to, I feel, with 
constancy.</p>
<p>I and my company (viz. Crabbe, etc.) could divert you but 
little until your mind is at rest about Mrs. Leigh.&nbsp; I shall
not even now write more than to say that a Letter from Mowbray, 
which tells of the kind way you received him and his Brother, 
says also that his Father is well, and expects Valentia and 
Spouse in November.</p>
<p>This is all I will write.&nbsp; You will let me know by a

<p>I need not tell you that I am very glad of the news your note

Everton Place, Leamington (as I read it in your former Letter), 
reached you.&nbsp; Whatever the place be called, I expect you are
still there; and there will be for some time longer.&nbsp; As 
there may be some anxiety for some little time, I shall not

<p>By the by, I think the time is come when, if you like me well 
enough, you may drop my long Surname, except for the external 
Address of your letter.&nbsp; It may seem, but is not, 
affectation to say that it is a name I dislike; <a

me some confusion and trouble with other more or less Irish 
bodies, being as common in Ireland as &lsquo;Smith,&rsquo; etc., 
here&mdash;and particularly with &lsquo;Edward&rsquo;&mdash;I 
suppose because of the patriot Lord who bore [it].&nbsp; I should
not, even if I made bold to wish so to do, propose to treat you

has become as it were classical in England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>Now that your anxieties are, as I hope, over, and that you are
returned, as I suppose, to London, I send you a budget.&nbsp; 
First: the famous <i>Belvidere Hat</i>; which I think you ought 
to stick into your Records. <a name="citation163a"></a><a 
href="#footnote163a" class="citation">[163a]</a>&nbsp; Were I a 
dozen years younger, I should illustrate all the Book in such a 
way; but, as my French song says, &lsquo;Le Temps est trop court 
pour de si longs projets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next, you behold a Photo of Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece, which he 
bid her send me two or three years ago in one of her half-yearly 
replies to my Enquiries.&nbsp; What a shrewd, tidy, little Scotch
Body!&nbsp; Then you have her last letter, telling of her Uncle, 
and her married Self, and thanking me for a little Wedding gift 
which I told her was bought from an Ipswich Pawnbroker <a 
name="citation163b"></a><a href="#footnote163b" 
class="citation">[163b]</a>&mdash;a very good, clever fellow, who
reads Carlyle, and comes over here now and then for a talk with 
me.&nbsp; Mind, when you return me the Photo, that you secure 
<!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
164</span>it around with your Letter paper, that the Postman may 
not stamp into it.&nbsp; Perhaps this trouble is scarce worth 
giving you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clerke Sanders&rsquo; has been familiar to me these 
fifty years almost; since Tennyson used to repeat it, and 
&lsquo;Helen of Kirkconnel,&rsquo; at some Cambridge 
gathering.&nbsp; At that time he looked something like the 
Hyperion shorn of his Beams in Keats&rsquo; Poem: with a Pipe in 
his mouth.&nbsp; Afterwards he got a touch, I used to say, of 
Haydon&rsquo;s Lazarus.&nbsp; Talking of Keats, do not forget to 
read Lord Houghton&rsquo;s Life and Letters of him: in which you 
will find what you may not have guessed from his Poetry (though 
almost unfathomably deep in that also) the strong, masculine, 
Sense and Humour, etc., of the man more akin to Shakespeare, I am
tempted to think, in a perfect circle of Poetic Faculties, than 
any Poet since.</p>
<p>Well: the Leaves which hung on more bravely than ever I 
remember are at last whirling away in a Cromwell 
Hurricane&mdash;(not quite that, neither)&mdash;and my old Man 
says he thinks Winter has set in at last.&nbsp; We cannot 
complain hitherto.&nbsp; Many summer flowers held out in my 
Garden till a week ago, when we dug up the Beds in order for next
year.&nbsp; So now little but the orange Marigold, which I love 
for its colour (Irish and Spanish) and Courage, in living all 
Winter through.&nbsp; Within doors, I am again at my everlasting 
Crabbe! doctoring his Posthumous Tales <i>&agrave; la mode</i> of
those of &lsquo;The Hall,&rsquo; to finish a Volume of simple 
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
165</span>&lsquo;Selections&rsquo; from his other works: all 
which I will leave to be used, or not, whenever old Crabbe rises 
up again: which will not be in the Lifetime of yours ever</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F.G.</p>
<p>I dared not decypher all that Mrs. Wister wrote in my 
behalf&mdash;because I knew it must be sincere!&nbsp; Would she 
care for my Eternal Crabbe?</p>
<h2>LXVI.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Nov.</i> 1879.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>I must say a word upon a word in your last which really pains 
me&mdash;about yours and Mrs. Wister&rsquo;s sincerity, 
etc.&nbsp; Why, I do most thoroughly believe in both; all I meant
was that, partly from your own old personal regard for me, and 
hers, perhaps inherited from you, you may both very sincerely 
over-rate my little dealings with other great men&rsquo;s 
thoughts.&nbsp; For you know full well that the best Head may be 
warped by as good a Heart beating under it; and one loves the 
Head and Heart all the more for it.&nbsp; Now all this is all so 
known to you that I am vexed you will not at once apply it to 
what I may have said.&nbsp; I do think that I have had to say 
something of the same sort before now; and I do declare I will 
not say it <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>again, for it is simply odious, all 
this talking of oneself.</p>
<p>Yet one thing more.&nbsp; I did go to London on this last 
occasion purposely to see you at that particular time: for I had 
not expected Mrs. Edwards to be in London till a Fortnight 
afterward, until two or three days after I had arranged to go and
meet you the very day you arrived, inasmuch as you had told me 
you were to be but a few days in Town.</p>
<p>There&mdash;there!&nbsp; Only believe me; my sincerity, Madam;
and&mdash;<i>Voil&agrave; ce qui est fait</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>Parlons</i>, etc.</p>
<p>Well: Mrs. Edwards has opened an Exhibition of her 
husband&rsquo;s works in Bond Street&mdash;contrary to my 
advice&mdash;and, it appears, rightly contrary: for over 
&pound;300 of them were sold on the first private View day, <a 
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166" 
class="citation">[166]</a> and Tom Taylor, the great Art Critic 
(who neither by Nature nor Education can be such, 
&lsquo;cleverest man in London,&rsquo; as Tennyson once said he 
was), has promised a laudatory notice in the omnipotent Times, 
and then People will flock in like Sheep.&nbsp; And I am very 
glad to be proved a Fool in the matter, though I hold my own 
opinion still of the merit of the Picture part of the Show.&nbsp;
Enough! as we Tragic Writers say: it is such a morning as I would
not have sacrificed indoors or in letter-writing to any one but 
yourself, and on the subject named.</p>

<p>Pray let me know how you have fared thus far through 
Winter&mdash;which began so early, and promises to continue so 
long.&nbsp; Even in Jersey Fred. Tennyson writes me it is all 
Snow and N.E. wind: and he says the North of Italy is blocked up 
with Snow.&nbsp; You may imagine that we are no better off in the
East of England.&nbsp; How is it in London, and with yourself in 
Queen Anne&rsquo;s Mansions?&nbsp; I fancy that you walk up and 
down that ante-room of yours for a regular time, as I force 
myself to do on a Landing-place in this house when I cannot get 
out upon what I call my Quarter-deck: a walk along a hedge by the
upper part of a field which &lsquo;dominates&rsquo; (as the 
phrase now goes) over my House and Garden.&nbsp; But I have for 
the last Fortnight had Lumbago, which makes it much easier to sit
down than to get up again.&nbsp; However, the time goes, and I am
surprised to find Sunday come round again.&nbsp; (Here is my 
funny little Reader come&mdash;to give me &lsquo;All the Year 
Round&rsquo; and Sam Slick.)</p>

<p>I suppose I should have finished this Letter in the way it 
begins, but by this noon&rsquo;s post comes a note from my 
Brother-in-law, De Soyres, telling me that <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>his wife 
Andalusia died yesterday. <a name="citation168"></a><a 
href="#footnote168" class="citation">[168]</a>&nbsp; She had 
somewhile suffered with a weak Heart, and this sudden and extreme
cold paralysed what vitality it had.&nbsp; But yesterday I had 
posted her a Letter re-enclosing two Photographs of her Grand 
Children whom she was very fond and proud of; and that Letter is 
too late, you see.&nbsp; Now, none but Jane Wilkinson and E. F.G.
remain of the many more that you remember, and always looked on 
with kindly regard.&nbsp; This news cuts my Letter shorter than 
it would have been; nevertheless pray let me know how you 
yourself are: and believe me yours</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ever and truly,<br />
E. F.G.</p>
<p>I have had no thought of going to London yet: but I shall 
never go in future without paying a Visit to you, if you like 
it.&nbsp; I know not how Mrs. Edwards&rsquo; Exhibition of her 
Husband&rsquo;s Pictures succeeds: I begged her to leave such a 
scheme alone; I cannot admire his Pictures now he is gone more 
than I did when he was here; but I hope that others will prove me
to be a bad adviser.</p>

<p>I think sufficient time has elapsed since my last letter to 
justify my writing you another, which, you <!-- page 169--><a 
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>know, means
calling on you to reply.&nbsp; When last you wrote, you were all 
in Flannel; pray let me hear you now are.&nbsp; Certainly, we are
better off in weather than a month ago: but I fancy these Fogs 
must have been dismal enough in London.&nbsp; A Letter which I 
have this morning from a Niece in Florence tells me they have had
&lsquo;London Fog&rsquo; (she says) for a Fortnight there.&nbsp; 
She says, that my sister Jane (your old Friend) is fairly well in
health, but very low in Spirits after that other Sister&rsquo;s 
Death.&nbsp; I will [not] say of myself that I have weathered 
away what Rheumatism and Lumbago I had; nearly so, however; and 
tramp about my Garden and Hedgerow as usual.&nbsp; And so I clear
off Family scores on my side.&nbsp; Pray let me know, when you 
tell of yourself, how Mrs. Leigh and those on the other side of 
the Atlantic fare.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Edwards, I doubt, is disappointed with her 
Husband&rsquo;s Gallery: not because of its only just repaying 
its expenses, except in so far as that implies that but few have 
been to see it.&nbsp; She says she feels as if she had nothing to
live for, now that &lsquo;her poor Old Dear&rsquo; is gone.&nbsp;
One fine day she went down to Woking where he lies, and&mdash;she
did not wish to come back.&nbsp; It was all solitary, and the 
grass beginning to spring, and a Blackbird or two singing.&nbsp; 
She ought, I think, to have left London, as her Doctor told her, 
for a total change of Scene; but she may know best, being a very 
clever, as well as devoted little Woman.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;you saw &lsquo;The Falcon&rsquo;? <a 
name="citation169"></a><a href="#footnote169" 
class="citation">[169]</a>&nbsp; Athen&aelig;um and <!-- page 
170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
170</span>Academy reported of it much as I expected.&nbsp; One of
them said the Story had been dramatised before: I wonder 
why.&nbsp; What reads lightly and gracefully in Boccaccio&rsquo;s
Prose, would surely not do well when drawn out into dramatic 
Detail: two People reconciled to Love over a roasted Hawk; about 
as unsavoury a Bird to eat as an Owl, I believe.&nbsp; No doubt 
there was a Chicken substitute at St. James&rsquo;, but one had 
to believe it to be Hawk; and, anyhow, I have always heard that 
it is very difficult to eat, and talk, on the Stage&mdash;though 
people seem to manage it easily enough in real Life.</p>
<p>By way of a Christmas Card I sent Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece a 
Postage one, directed to myself, on the back of which she might 
[write] a few words as to how he and herself had weathered the 
late Cold.&nbsp; She replied that he was well: had not 
relinquished his daily Drives: and was (when she wrote) reading 
Shakespeare and Boswell&rsquo;s Hebrides.&nbsp; The mention of 
him reminds me of your saying&mdash;or writing&mdash;that you 
felt shy of &lsquo;intruding&rsquo; yourself upon him by a 
Visit.&nbsp; My dear Mrs. Kemble, this is certainly a mistake 
(wilful?) of yours; he may have too many ordinary Visitors; but I
am quite sure that he would be gratified at your taking the 
trouble to go and see him.&nbsp; Pray try, weather and flannel 
permitting.</p>
<p>I find some good Stuff in Bagehot&rsquo;s Essays, in spite of 
his name, which is simply &lsquo;Bagot,&rsquo; as men call 
it.&nbsp; Also, I find Hayward&rsquo;s Select Essays so agreeable
that I suppose they are very superficial.</p>
<p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

am told) very superficial indeed, as compared to George Eliot, 
whom I cannot relish at all.</p>
<p>Thus much has come easily to my pen this day, and run on, you

<p>I do not think it is a full month since I last taxed you for 
some account of yourself: but we have had hard weather, you know,
ever since: your days have been very dark in London, I am told, 
and as we have all been wheezing under them, down here, I want to
know how you stand it all.&nbsp; I only hope my MS. is not very 
bad; for I am writing by Candle, before my Reader comes.&nbsp; He
eat such a Quantity of Cheese and Cake between the Acts that he 
could scarce even see to read at all after; so I had to <!-- page
172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>remind him that, though he was not quite sixteen, he 
had much exceeded the years of a Pig.&nbsp; Since which we get on
better.&nbsp; I did not at all like to have my Dombey spoiled; 
especially Captain Cuttle, God bless him, and his Creator, now 
lying in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; The intended Pathos is, as 
usual, missed: but just turn to little Dombey&rsquo;s Funeral, 
where the Acrobat in the Street suspends his performance till the
Funeral has passed, and his Wife wonders if the little Acrobat in
her Arms will so far outlive the little Boy in the Hearse as to 
wear a Ribbon through his hair, following his Father&rsquo;s 
Calling.&nbsp; It is in such Side-touches, you know, that Dickens
is inspired to Create like a little God Almighty.&nbsp; I have 
read half his lately published letters, which, I think, add 
little to Forster&rsquo;s Account, unless in the way of showing 
what a good Fellow Dickens was.&nbsp; Surely it does not seem 
that his Family were not fond of him, as you supposed?</p>
<p>I have been to Lowestoft for a week to see my capital Nephew, 
Edmund Kerrich, before he goes to join his Regiment in 
Ireland.&nbsp; I wish you could see him make his little (six 
years old) put him through his Drill.&nbsp; That is worthy of 
Dickens: and I am always yours sincerely&mdash;and I do hope not 
just now very illegibly&mdash;</p>

<p>A week ago I had a somewhat poor account of Donne from Edith 
D.&mdash;that he had less than his usually little Appetite, and 
could not sleep without Chloral.&nbsp; This Account I at first 
thought of sending to you: but then I thought you would soon be 
back in London to hear [of] him yourself; so I sent it to his 
great friend Merivale, who, I thought, must have less means of 
hearing about him at Ely.&nbsp; I enclose you this Dean&rsquo;s 
letter: which you will find worth the trouble of decyphering, as 
all this Dean&rsquo;s are.&nbsp; And you will see there is a word

&lsquo;devoured&rsquo; a Year ago, as a letter of his then told 
me; and I suppose that his other word about the number of your 
Father&rsquo;s house refers to something in those Records.&nbsp; 
I am not surprised at such an Historian reading your Records: but
I was surprised to find him reading Charles Mathews&rsquo; 
Memoir, as you will see he has been doing.&nbsp; I told him I had
been reading it: but then that is all in my line.&nbsp; Have 
you?&nbsp; No, I think: nor I, by the way, quite half, and that 
in Vol. ii.&mdash;where is really <!-- page 174--><a

gone away from his house.&nbsp; I should not mind that, only you 
will persist in answering what calls for no answer.&nbsp; But the

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>:</p>
<p>The Moon has reminded me that it is a month since I last went 
up to London.&nbsp; I said to the Cabman who took me to Queen 
Anne&rsquo;s, &lsquo;I think it must be close on Full 
Moon,&rsquo; and he said, &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo;
not troubling himself to look back to the Abbey over which she 
was riding.&nbsp; Well; I am sure I have little enough to tell 
you; but I shall be glad to hear from you that you are well and 
comfortable, if nothing else.&nbsp; And you see that I am putting
my steel pen into its very best paces all for you.&nbsp; By far 
the chief incident in my life for the last month has been the 
reading of dear old Spedding&rsquo;s Paper on the Merchant of 
Venice: <a name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176" 
class="citation">[176]</a> there, at any rate, is one Question 
settled, and in such a beautiful way as only he commands.&nbsp; I
could not help writing a few lines to tell him what I thought; 
but even very sincere praise is not the way to conciliate 
him.&nbsp; About Christmas I wrote him, relying on it that I 
should be most likely to secure an answer if I expressed dissent 
from some other work of his; and my expectation was justified by 
one of the fullest answers he had written to me for many a day 
and year.</p>
<p>I read in one of my Papers that Tennyson had <!-- page 
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
177</span>another Play accepted at the Lyceum.&nbsp; I think he 
is obstinate in such a purpose, but, as he is a Man of Genius, he
may surprise us still by a vindication of what seem to me several
Latter-day failures.&nbsp; I suppose it is as hard for him to 
relinquish his Vocation as other men find it to be in other 
callings to which they have been devoted; but I think he had 
better not encumber the produce of his best days by publishing so
much of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Under the cold Winds and Frosts which have lately visited 
us&mdash;and their visit promises to be a long one&mdash;my 
garden Flowers can scarce get out of the bud, even Daffodils have
hitherto failed to &lsquo;take the winds,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; 
Crocuses early nipt and shattered (in which my Pigeons help the 
winds) and Hyacinths all ready, if but they might!</p>
<p>My Sister Lusia&rsquo;s Widower has sent me a Drawing by Sir 
T. Lawrence of my Mother: bearing a surprising resemblance 
to&mdash;The Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; This was done in her 
earlier days&mdash;I suppose, not long after I was born&mdash;for
her, and his (Lawrence&rsquo;s) friend Mrs. Wolff: and though, I 
think, too Wellingtonian, the only true likeness of her.&nbsp; 
Engravings were made of it&mdash;so good as to be facsimiles, I 
think&mdash;to be given away to Friends.&nbsp; I should think 
your mother had one.&nbsp; If you do not know it, I will bring 
the Drawing up with me to London when next I go there: or will 
send it up for your inspection, if you like.&nbsp; But I do not 
suppose you will care for me to do that.</p>

poetic Taste.</p>

<p>No&mdash;the Flowers were not from me&mdash;I have nothing 
full-blown to show except a few Polyanthuses, and a few 
Pansies.&nbsp; These Pansies never throve with me till last year:
after a Cartload or two of Clay laid on my dry soil, I suppose, 
the year before.&nbsp; Insomuch that one dear little Soul has 
positively held on blowing, more or less confidently, all winter 
through; when even the Marigold failed.</p>
<p>Now, I meant to have intimated about those Flowers in a few 
French words on a Postcard&mdash;purposely to prevent your 
answering&mdash;unless your rigorous Justice could only be 
satisfied by a Post Card in return.&nbsp; But I was not sure how 
you might like my Card; so here is a Letter instead; which I <!--

answer.&nbsp; A time will come for such a word.</p>
<p>By the by, you can make me one very acceptable return, I hope 
with no further trouble than addressing it to me.&nbsp; That 
&lsquo;Nineteenth Century&rsquo; for February, with a Paper on 
&lsquo;King John&rsquo; (your Uncle) in it. <a

get it&mdash;&lsquo;out of print.&rsquo;&nbsp; I rather doubt 
that the Copy I saw on your Table was only lent to you; if so, 
take no more trouble about it; some one will find me a Copy.</p>
<p>I shall revolve in my own noble mind what you say about 
Jessica and her Jewels: as yet, I am divided between you, and 
that old Serpent, Spedding.&nbsp; Perhaps &lsquo;That is only his
Fancy,&rsquo; as he says of Shylock.&nbsp; What a light, 
graceful, way of saying well-considered Truth!</p>
<p>I doubt you are serious in reminding me of my Tumbler on the 
Floor; and, I doubt not, quite right in being so.&nbsp; This 
comes of one&rsquo;s living so long either with no Company, or 
with only free and easy.&nbsp; But I am always the same toward 
you, whether my Tumbler in the right place or not,</p>

<p>I think this Atlantic, <a name="citation180b"></a><a

whom I had sent my Crabbe; and he had, I suppose, shown it to Mr.
Woodberry, the Critic.&nbsp; And the Critic has done his work 
well, on the whole, I think: though not quite up to my mark of 
praise, nor enough to create any revival of Interest in the 
Poems.&nbsp; You will see that I have made two or three notes by 
the way: but you are still less bound to read them than the 
text.</p>
<p>If you be not bothered, I shall ask you to return <!-- page

the Magazine.&nbsp; I have some thought of taking it in again, as
I like to see what goes on in the literary way in America, and I 
found their critics often more impartial in their estimation of 
English Authors than our own Papers are, as one might guess would
be the case.</p>
<p>I was, and am, reading your Records again, before this

<p>I was really sorry to hear from you that you were about to 
move again.&nbsp; I suppose the move has been made by this time: 
as I do not know whither, I must trouble Coutts, I suppose, to 
forward my Letter to you; and then you will surely tell me your 
new Address, and also how you find yourself in it.</p>
<p>I have nothing to report of myself, except that I was for ten 
days at Lowestoft in company (though not in the house) with 
Edward Cowell the Professor: with whom, as in last Autumn, I 
read, and all but finished, the second part of Don Quixote.&nbsp;
There came Aldis Wright to join us; and he quite agrees with what
you say concerning the Jewel-robbery in the Merchant of 
Venice.&nbsp; He read me the Play; and very well; thoroughly 
understanding the text: with clear articulation, and the moderate
emphasis proper to room-reading; with the advantage also of never
having known the Theatre in his youth, so that he has not picked 
up the twang of any Actor of the Day.&nbsp; Then he read me King 
John, which he has some thoughts of editing next after Richard 
III.&nbsp; And I was reminded of you at Ipswich twenty-eight 
years ago; and of your Father&mdash;his look up at Angiers&rsquo;
Walls as he went out in Act ii.&nbsp; I wonder that Mrs. <!-- 
page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Constance to any of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Characters: perhaps I 
misremember; she may have said Queen Catharine. <a

class="citation">[183a]</a>&nbsp; I must not forget to thank you 
for the Nineteenth Century from Hatchard&rsquo;s; Tieck&rsquo;s 
Article very interesting to me, and I should suppose just in its 
criticism as to what John Kemble then was.&nbsp; I have a little 
print of him about the time: in &OElig;dipus&mdash;(whose Play, I
wonder, on such a dangerous subject?) from a Drawing by that very
clever Artist De Wilde: who never missed Likeness, Character, and
Life, even when reduced to 16mo Engraving. <a

class="citation">[183b]</a></p>
<p>What you say of Tennyson&rsquo;s Eyes reminded me that he 
complained of the Dots in Persian type flickering before them: 
insomuch that he gave up studying it.&nbsp; This was some thirty 
years ago.&nbsp; Talking on the subject one day to his Brother 
Frederick, he&mdash;(Frederick)&mdash;said he thought possible 
that a sense of the Sublime was connected with Blindness: as in 
Homer, Milton, and Handel: and somewhat with old Wordsworth 
perhaps; though his Eyes were, I think, rather weak than 
consuming with any inward Fire.</p>
<p>I heard from Mr. Norton that Lowell had returned <!-- page 
184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>to
Madrid in order to bring his Wife to London&mdash;if 
possible.&nbsp; She seems very far from being recovered; and 
(Norton thinks) would not have recovered in Spain: so Lowell will
have one consolation for leaving the land of Cervantes and 
Calderon to come among the English, whom I believe he likes 
little better than Hawthorne liked them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>Another full Moon reminds [me] of my monthly call upon you by 
Letter&mdash;a call to be regularly returned, I know, according 
to your Etiquette.&nbsp; As so it must be, I shall be very glad 
to hear that <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>you are better than when you last 
wrote, and that some, if not all, of the &lsquo;trouble&rsquo; 
you spoke of has passed away.&nbsp; I have not heard of Donne 
since that last letter of yours: but a Post Card from Mowbray, 
who was out holyday-making in Norfolk, tells me that he will 
write as soon as he has returned to London, which, I think, must 
be about this very time.</p>
<p>I shall be sorry if you do not get your annual dose of 
Mountain Air; why can you not? postponing your visit to Hampshire
till Autumn&mdash;a season when I think those who want company 
and comfort are most glad of it.&nbsp; But you are determined, I 
think, to do as you are asked: yes, even the more so if you do 
not wish it.&nbsp; And, moreover, you know much more of what is 
fittest to do than I.</p>
<p>A list of Trench&rsquo;s works in the Academy made me think of
sending him my Crabbe; which I did: and had a very kind answer 
from him, together with a Copy of a second Edition of his 
Calderon Essay and Translation.&nbsp; He had not read any Crabbe 
since he was a Lad: what he may think of him now I know not: for 
I bid him simply acknowledge the receipt of my Volume, as I did 
of his.&nbsp; I think much the best way, unless advice is wanted 
on either side before publication.</p>
<p>If you write&mdash;which you will, unless&mdash;nay, whether 
troubled or not, I think&mdash;I should like to hear if you have 
heard anything of Mr. Lowell in London.&nbsp; I do not write to 
him for fear of bothering him: but <!-- page 186--><a 
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>I wish to 
know that his Wife is recovered.&nbsp; I have been thinking for 
some days of writing a Note to Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece, enclosing 
her a Post Card to be returned to me with just a word about him 
and herself.&nbsp; A Card only: for I do not know how occupied 
she may be with her own family cares by this time.</p>
<p>I have re-read your Records, in which I do not know that I 
find any too much, as I had thought there was of some early 
Letters.&nbsp; Which I believe I told you while the Book was in 
progress. <a name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186" 
class="citation">[186]</a>&nbsp; It is, I sincerely say, a 
capital Book, and, as I have now read it twice over with 
pleasure, and I will say, with Admiration&mdash;if but for its 
Sincerity (I think you will not mind my saying that much)&mdash;I
shall probably read it over again, if I live two years 
more.&nbsp; I am now embarked on my blessed 
S&eacute;vign&eacute;, who, with Crabbe, and John Wesley, seem to
be my great hobbies; or such as I do not tire of riding, though 
my friends may weary of hearing me talk about them.</p>
<p>By the by, to-morrow is, I think, Derby Day; which I remember 
chiefly for its marking the time when Hampton Court Chestnuts 
were usually in full flower.&nbsp; You may guess that we in the 
Country here have been gaping for rain to bring on our Crops, and
Flowers; very tantalising have been many promising Clouds, which 
just dropped a few drops by way of Compliment, and then passed 
on.&nbsp; But last <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>night, when Dombey was being read to
me we heard a good splash of rain, and Dombey was shut up that we
might hear, and see, and feel it. <a name="citation187"></a><a 
href="#footnote187" class="citation">[187]</a>&nbsp; I never 
could make out who wrote two lines which I never could forget, 
wherever I found them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Abroad, the rushing Tempest overwhelms<br 
/>
Nature pitch dark, and rides the thundering elms.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very like Glorious John Dryden; but many others of his time 
wrote such lines, as no one does now&mdash;not even Messrs. 
Swinburne and Browning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>You smile at my &lsquo;Lunacies&rsquo; as you call my writing 
periods; I take the Moon as a signal not to tax you too often for
your inevitable answer.&nbsp; I have now let her pass her Full: 
and June is drawing short: <!-- page 188--><a 
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>and you 
were to be but for June at Leamington: so&mdash;I must have your 
answer, to tell me about your own health (which was not so good 
when last you wrote) and that of your Family; and when, and 
where, you go from Leamington.&nbsp; I shall be sorry if you 
cannot go to Switzerland.</p>
<p>I have been as far as&mdash;Norfolk&mdash;on a week&rsquo;s 
visit (the only visit of the sort I now make) to George Crabbe, 
my Poet&rsquo;s Grandson, and his two Granddaughters.&nbsp; It 
was a very pleasant visit indeed; the people all so sensible, and
friendly, talking of old days; the Country flat indeed, but 
green, well-wooded, and well-cultivated: the weather well enough.
<a name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a" 
class="citation">[188a]</a></p>
<p>I carried there two volumes of my S&eacute;vign&eacute;: and 
even talked of going over to Brittany, only to see her Rochers, 
as once I went to Edinburgh only to see Abbotsford.&nbsp; But 
(beside that I probably should not have gone further than talking
in any case) a French Guide Book informed me that the present 
Proprietor of the place will not let it be shown to Strangers who
pester him for a view of it, on the strength of those 
&lsquo;paperasses,&rsquo; as he calls her Letters. <a 
name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b" 
class="citation">[188b]</a>&nbsp; So this is rather a comfort to 
me.&nbsp; Had I gone, I <!-- page 189--><a 
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>should also
have visited my dear old Frederick Tennyson at Jersey.&nbsp; But 
now I think we shall never see one another again.</p>
<p>Spedding keeps on writing Shakespeare Notes in answer to 
sundry Theories broached by others: he takes off copies of his 
MS. by some process he has learned; and, as I always insist on 
some Copy of all he writes, he has sent me these, which I read by
instalments, as Eyesight permits.&nbsp; I believe I am not a fair
Judge between him and his adversaries; first, because I have but 
little, if any, faculty of critical Analysis; and secondly, 
because I am prejudiced with the notion that old Jem is 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Prophet, and must be right.&nbsp; But, 
whether right or wrong, the way in which he conducts, and pleads,
his Case is always Music to me.&nbsp; So it was even with Bacon, 
with whom I could not be reconciled: I could not like Dr. Fell: 
much more so with &lsquo;the Divine Williams,&rsquo; who is a 
Doctor that I do like.</p>
<p>It has turned so dark here in the last two days that I scarce 
see to write at my desk by a window which has a hood over it, 
meant to exclude&mdash;the Sun!&nbsp; I have increased my Family 
by two broods of Ducks, who compete for the possession of a Pond 
about four feet in diameter: and but an hour ago I saw my old 
Seneschal escorting home a stray lot of Chickens.&nbsp; My two 
elder Nieces are with me at present, but I do not think will be 
long here, if a Sister comes to them from Italy.</p>
<p>Pray let me hear how you are.&nbsp; I am pretty well <!-- page

<p>&lsquo;Il sera le mois de Juillet tant qu&rsquo;il plaira 
&agrave; Dieu&rsquo; writes my friend 
S&eacute;vign&eacute;&mdash;only a week more of it now, 
however.&nbsp; I should have written to my friend Mrs. Kemble 
before this&mdash;in defiance of the Moon&mdash;had I not been 
waiting for her Address from Mowbray Donne, to whom I wrote more 
than a fortnight ago.&nbsp; I hope no ill-health in himself, or 
his Family, keeps him from answering my Letter, if it ever 
reached him.&nbsp; But I will wait no longer for his reply: for I
want to know concerning you and your health: and so I must 
trouble Coutts to fill up the Address which you will not instruct
me in.</p>
<p>Here (Woodbridge) have I been since last I wrote&mdash;some 
Irish Cousins coming down as soon as English Nieces had 
left.&nbsp; Only that in the week&rsquo;s interval I went to our 
neighbouring Aldeburgh on <!-- page 191--><a 
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>the 
Sea&mdash;where I first saw, and felt, the Sea some sixty-five 
years ago; a dreary place enough in spite of some Cockney 
improvements: my old Crabbe&rsquo;s Borough, as you may 
remember.&nbsp; I think one goes back to the old haunts as one 
grows old: as the Chancellor l&rsquo;H&ocirc;pital said when he 
returned to his native Bourdeaux, I think: &lsquo;Me voici, 
Messieurs,&rsquo; returned to die, as the Hare does, in her 
ancient &lsquo;g&icirc;te.&rsquo; <a name="citation191"></a><a 
href="#footnote191" class="citation">[191]</a>&nbsp; I shall soon
be going to Lowestoft, where one of my Nieces, who is married to 
an Italian, and whom I have not seen for many years, is come, 
with her Boy, to stay with her Sisters.</p>
<p>Whither are you going after you leave Hampshire?&nbsp; You 
spoke in your last letter of Scarboro&rsquo;: but I still think 
you will get over to Switzerland.&nbsp; One of my old 
Friends&mdash;and Flames&mdash;Mary Lynn (pretty name) who is of 
our age, and played with me when we both were Children&mdash;at 
that very same Aldeburgh&mdash;is gone over to those Mountains 
which you are so fond of: having the same passion for them as you
have.&nbsp; I had asked her to meet me at that 
Aldeburgh&mdash;&lsquo;Aldbro&rsquo;&rsquo;&mdash;that we might 
ramble together along that beach where once we played; but she 
was gone.</p>
<p>If you should come to Lowestoft instead of Scarbro&rsquo;, we,
if you please, will ramble together too.&nbsp; But I do not 
recommend the place&mdash;very ugly&mdash;on a <!-- page 192--><a

Sea&mdash;and I do not suppose you would care for any of my 
People; unless it were my little Niece Annie, who is a delightful
Creature.</p>
<p>I see by the Athen&aelig;um that Tom Taylor is dead <a 
name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a" 
class="citation">[192a]</a>&mdash;the &lsquo;cleverest Man in 
London&rsquo; Tennyson called him forty years ago.&nbsp; 
Professor Goodwin, of the Boston Cambridge, is in England, and 
made a very kind proposal to give me a look on his travels.&nbsp;
But I could not let him come out of his way (as it would have 
been) for any such a purpose. <a name="citation192b"></a><a 
href="#footnote192b" class="citation">[192b]</a>&nbsp; He wrote 
that Mrs. Lowell was in better health: residing at Southampton, 
which you knew well near fifty years ago, as your Book 
tells.&nbsp; Mr. Lowell does not write to me now; nor is there 
reason that he should.</p>
<p>Please to make my remembrances to Mr. Sartoris, <!-- page 
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

1880.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>I send you Mowbray&rsquo;s reply to my letter of nearly three 
weeks ago.&nbsp; No good news of his Father&mdash;still less of 
our Army (news to me told to-day) altogether a sorry budget to 
greet you on your return to London.&nbsp; But the public news you
knew already, I doubt not: and I thought as well to tell you of 
our Donne at once.</p>
<p>I suppose one should hardly talk of anything except this 
Indian Calamity: <a name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193"
class="citation">[193]</a> but I am selfish enough to ignore, as 
much as I can, such Evils as I cannot help.</p>
<p>I think that Tennyson in calling Tom Taylor the 
&lsquo;cleverest man,&rsquo; etc., meant pretty much as you 
do.&nbsp; I believe he said it in reply to something I may have 
said that was less laudatory.&nbsp; At one time Tennyson almost 
lived with him and the Wigans whom I did <!-- page 194--><a 
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>not 
know.&nbsp; Taylor always seemed to me as &lsquo;clever&rsquo; as
any one: was always very civil to me: but one of those toward 
whom I felt no attraction.&nbsp; He was too clever, I 
think.&nbsp; As to Art, he knew nothing of it then, nor (as he 
admits) up to 1852 or thereabout, when he published his very good
Memoir of Haydon.&nbsp; I think he was too &lsquo;clever&rsquo; 
for Art also.</p>
<p>Why will you write of &lsquo;If you <i>bid</i> me come to 
Lowestoft in October,&rsquo; etc., which, you must know, is just 
what I should not ask you to do: knowing that, after what you 
say, you would come, if asked, were&mdash;(a Bull begins 
here)&mdash;were it ever so unlikely for you.&nbsp; I am going 
thither next week, to hear much (I dare say) of a Brother in 
Ireland who may be called to India; and am</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ever yours sincerely,<br />

<p>Why won&rsquo;t you write to me from Switzerland to say where

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>Here is a second Full Moon since last I wrote&mdash;(Harvest 
Moon, I think).&nbsp; I knew not where to <!-- page 195--><a 
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>direct to 
you before, and, as you remain determined not to apprize me 
yourself, so I have refused to send through Coutts.&nbsp; You do 
not lose much.</p>
<p>Here have been for nearly two months Five English Nieces 
clustered round a Sister who married an Italian, and has not been
in England these dozen years.&nbsp; She has brought her Boy of 
six, who seems to us wonderfully clever as compared to English 
Children of his Age, but who, she tells us, is counted rather 
behind his Fellows in Italy.&nbsp; Our meeting has been what is 
called a &lsquo;Success&rsquo;&mdash;which will not be repeated, 
I think.&nbsp; She will go back to her adopted Country in about a
month, I suppose.&nbsp; Do you know of any one likely to be going
that way about that time?</p>
<p>Some days ago, when I was sitting on the Pier, rather sad at 
the Departure [of] a little Niece&mdash;an abridgment of all that
is pleasant&mdash;and good&mdash;in Woman&mdash;Charles Merivale 
accosted me&mdash;he and his good, unaffected, sensible, wife, 
and Daughter to match.&nbsp; He was looking well, and we have 
since had a daily stroll together.&nbsp; We talked of you, for he
said (among the first things he did say) that he had been reading
your Records again: so I need not tell you his opinion of 
them.&nbsp; He saw your Uncle in Cato when he was about four 
years old; and believes that he (J. P. K.) had a bit of red 
waistcoat looking out of his toga, by way of Blood.&nbsp; I tell 
him he should call on you and clear up that, and talk on many 
other points.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Father was going on pretty well.&nbsp; I asked for further from 
Mowbray when he should have returned from Wales: but he has not 
yet written.&nbsp; Merivale, who is one of Donne&rsquo;s greatest
Friends, has not heard of him more lately than I.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Mrs. Kemble, I want to hear of you from yourself:
and I have told you why it is that I have not asked you 
before.&nbsp; I fancy that you will not be back in England when 
this Letter reaches Westminster: but I fancy that it will not be 
long before you find it waiting on your table for you.</p>
<p>And now I am going to look for the Dean, who, I hope, has been
at Church this morning: and though I have not done that, I am not
the less sincerely yours</p>

<p>I was to have gone to London on Monday with my Italian Niece 
on her way homeward.&nbsp; But she feared saying 
&lsquo;Farewell&rsquo; and desired me to let her set off alone, 
to avoid doing so.</p>
<p>Thus I delay my visit to you till November&mdash;perhaps 
toward the middle of it: when I hope to <!-- page 197--><a 
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>find you, 
with your blue and crimson Cushions <a name="citation197"></a><a 
href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a> in Queen 
Anne&rsquo;s Mansions, as a year ago.&nbsp; Mrs. Edwards is 
always in town: not at all forgetful of her husband; and there 
will be our Donne also of whom I hear nothing, and so conclude 
there is nothing to be told, and with him my Visits will be 
summed up.</p>
<p>Now, lose not a Day in providing yourself with Charles 
Tennyson Turner&rsquo;s Sonnets, published by Kegan Paul.&nbsp; 
There is a Book for you to keep on your table, at your 
elbow.&nbsp; Very many of the Sonnets I do not care for: mostly 
because of the Subject: but there is pretty sure to be some 
beautiful line or expression in all; and all pure, tender, noble,
and&mdash;original.&nbsp; Old Spedding supplies a beautiful Prose
Overture to this delightful Volume: never was Critic more one 
with his Subject&mdash;or, Object, is it?&nbsp; Frederick 
Tennyson, my old friend, ought to have done something to live 
along with his Brothers: all who <i>will</i> live, I believe, of 
their Generation: and he perhaps would, if he could, have 
confined himself to limits not quite so narrow as the 
Sonnet.&nbsp; But he is a Poet, and cannot be harnessed.</p>
<p>I have still a few flowers surviving in my Garden; and I 
certainly never remember the foliage of trees so little changed 
in October&rsquo;s third week.&nbsp; A little flight of Snow 
however: whose first flight used to <!-- page 198--><a

<p>Here is the Moon very near her Full: so I send you a 
Letter.&nbsp; I have it in my head you are not in London: and may
not be when I go up there for a few days next week&mdash;for this
reason I think so: viz., that you have not acknowledged a Copy of
Charles Tennyson&rsquo;s Sonnets, which I desired Kegan Paul to 
send you, as from me&mdash;with my illustrious Initials on the 
Fly Leaf: and, he or one of his men, wrote that so it should be, 
or had been done.&nbsp; It may nevertheless not have been: or, if
in part done, the illustrious Initials forgotten.&nbsp; But I 
rather think the Book was sent: and that you would have guessed 
at the Sender, Initials or not.&nbsp; And as I know you are even 
over-scrupulous in acknowledging any such things, I gather that 
the Book came when you had left London&mdash;for Leamington, very
likely: and that there you are now.&nbsp; The Book, and your 
Acknowledgment <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>of it, will very well wait: but I 
wish to hear about yourself&mdash;as also about yours&mdash;if 
you should be among them.&nbsp; I talk of &lsquo;next 
week,&rsquo; because one of my few Visitors, Archdeacon Groome, 
is coming the week after that, I believe, for a day or two to my 
house: and, as he has not been here for two years, I do not wish 
to be out of the way.</p>
<p>A Letter about a fortnight ago from Mowbray Donne told me that
his Father was fairly well: and a Post Card from Mowbray two days
ago informed [me] that Valentia was to be in London this present 
week.&nbsp; But I have wanted to be here at home all this time: I
would rather see Donne when he is alone: and I would rather go to
London when there is more likelihood of seeing you there than now
seems to me.&nbsp; Of course you will not in the slightest way 
hasten your return to London (if now away from it) for my poor 
little Visits: but pray let me hear from you, and believe me 
always the same</p>

<p>As to the Tea&mdash;&lsquo;pure and simple&rsquo;&mdash;with 
Bread and Butter&mdash;it is the only meal I do care to join

not his Dinner till an hour and a half after my last meal is 
done.</p>
<p>I should very gladly have &lsquo;crushed a Cup of Tea&rsquo; 
with you that last Evening, coming prepared so to do.&nbsp; But 
you had Friends coming; and so (as Mrs. Edwards was in the same 
plight) I went to the Pit of my dear old Haymarket Opera: <a 
name="citation200"></a><a href="#footnote200" 
class="citation">[200]</a> remembering the very corner of the 
Stage where Pasta stood when Jason&rsquo;s People came to tell 
her of his new Marriage; and (with one hand in her Girdle&mdash;a
movement (Mrs. Frere said) borrowed from Grassini) she 
interrupted them with her 
&ldquo;Cessate&mdash;intesi!&rdquo;&mdash;also when Rubini, 
feathered hat in hand, began that &ldquo;Ah te, oh 
Cara&rdquo;&mdash;and Taglioni hovered over the Stage.&nbsp; 
There was the old Omnibus Box too where D&rsquo;Orsay flourished 
in ample white Waistcoat and Wristbands: and Lady 
Blessington&rsquo;s: and Lady Jersey&rsquo;s on the Pit tier: and
my own Mother&rsquo;s, among the lesser Stars, on the <!-- page 
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Company of less distinction in all respects; and heard an Opera 
(<i>Carmen</i>) on the Wagner model: very beautiful 
Accompaniments to no Melody: and all very badly sung except by 
Trebelli, who, excellent.&nbsp; I ran out in the middle to the 
dear Little Haymarket opposite&mdash;where Vestris and Liston

is a bit of Translation from an old War Song which shows <!--

and I have always said that &rsquo;tis for the old Poets to do 
some such service for their Predecessors.&nbsp; I hope this long

[1880.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>:</p>
<p>You are at Leamington for this day, I expect: but, as I am not
sure of your address there, I direct to Queen Anne as 
usual.&nbsp; This very morning I had a letter from my dear George
Crabbe, telling me that he has met your friend Mr. H. 
A&iuml;d&eacute; at Lord Walsingham&rsquo;s, the Lord of G. 
C.&rsquo;s parish: and that Mr. A&iuml;d&eacute; had asked him 
(G. C.) for his copy of my Crabbe.&nbsp; I should have been very 
glad to give him one had he, or you, mentioned to me that he had 
any wish for the book: I am only somewhat disappointed that so 
few do care to ask for it.</p>
<p>I am here all alone for my Christmas: which is not quite my 
own fault.&nbsp; A Nephew, and a young London clerk, were to have
come, but prevented; even my little Reader is gone to London for 
his Holyday, and left me with Eyes more out of <i>Kelter</i> <a

to entertain myself with.&nbsp; &lsquo;These are my troubles, Mr.
Wesley,&rsquo; as a rich man complained to him when his Servant 
put too many Coals on the fire. <a name="citation203a"></a><a 
href="#footnote203a" class="citation">[203a]</a>&nbsp; On Friday,
Aldis Wright comes for two days, on his road to his old home 
Beccles: and I shall leave him to himself with Books and a Cigar 
most part of the Day, and make him read Shakespeare of a 
night.&nbsp; He is now editing Henry V. for what they call the 
Clarendon Press.&nbsp; He still knows nothing of Mr. Furness, 
who, he thinks, must be home in America long ago.</p>
<p>Spedding writes me that Carlyle is now so feeble as to be 
carried up and down stairs.&nbsp; But very &lsquo;quiet,&rsquo; 
which is considered a bad sign; but, as Spedding says, surely 
much better than the other alternative, into which one of 
Carlyle&rsquo;s temperament might so probably have fallen.&nbsp; 
Nay, were it not better for all of us?&nbsp; Mr. Froude is most 
constantly with him.</p>
<p>If this Letter is forwarded you, I know that it will not be 
long before I hear from you.&nbsp; And you know that I wish to 
hear that all is well with you, and that I am always yours</p>

<p>The Moon has passed her Full: but my Eyes have become so 
troubled since Christmas that I have not written before.&nbsp; 
All Christmas I was alone: Aldis Wright came to me on New 
Year&rsquo;s Day, and read to me, among many other things, 
&lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo; which we could not take much 
delight in.&nbsp; No Play more undoubtedly, nor altogether, 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, but seeming to me written off for some 
&lsquo;occasion&rsquo; theatrical, and then, I suppose that Mrs. 
Siddons made much of the Statue Scene.</p>
<p>I cannot write much, and I fancy that you will not care to 
read much, if you are indeed about to leave Queen Anne.&nbsp; 
That is a very vexatious business.&nbsp; You will probably be 
less inclined to write an answer to my letter, than to read it: 
but answer it you will: and you need trouble yourself to say no 
more than how you are, and where, and when, you are going, if 
indeed you leave where you are.&nbsp; And do not cross your

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>:</p>
<p>I expected to send you a piece of Print as well as a Letter 
this Full Moon. <a name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205" 
class="citation">[205]</a>&nbsp; But the Print is not come from 
the Printer&rsquo;s: and perhaps that is as well: for now you can
thank me for it beforehand when you reply (as I know you will) to
this Letter&mdash;and no more needs to be said.&nbsp; For I do 
[not] need your Advice as to Publication in this case; no such 
Design is in my head: on the contrary, not even a Friend will 
know of it except yourself, Mr. Norton, and Aldis Wright: the 
latter of whom would not be of the party but that he happened to 
be here when I was too purblind to correct the few Proofs, and 
very kindly did so for me.&nbsp; As for Mr. Norton (America), he 
it was for whom it was printed at all&mdash;at his wish, he 
knowing the MS. had been lying by me unfinisht for years.&nbsp; 
It is a Version of the two &OElig;dipus Plays of Sophocles united
as two Parts of one Drama.&nbsp; I should not send it to you but 
that I feel sure that, if you are in fair health and spirits, you
will be considerably interested in it, and probably give me more 
credit for my share in it than I deserve.&nbsp; As I make sure of
this you see there will be no need to say anything more about 
it.&nbsp; The Chorus part is not mine, <!-- page 206--><a 
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>as you will
see; but probably quite as good.&nbsp; Quite enough on that 
score.</p>
<p>I really want to know how you like your new Quarters in dear 
<i>old</i> London: how you are; and whether relieved from Anxiety
concerning Mr. Leigh.&nbsp; It was a Gale indeed, such as the 
oldest hereabout say they do not remember: but it was all from 
the East: and I do not see why it should have travelled over the 
Atlantic.</p>
<p>If you are easy on that account, and otherwise pretty well in 
mind and Body, tell me if you have been to see the Lyceum 
&lsquo;Cup&rsquo; <a name="citation206a"></a><a 
href="#footnote206a" class="citation">[206a]</a> and what you 
make of it.&nbsp; Somebody sent me a Macmillan <a 
name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b" 
class="citation">[206b]</a> with an Article about it by Lady 
Pollock; the extracts she gave seemed to me a somewhat lame 
imitation of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I venture to think&mdash;and what is more daring&mdash;to 
write, that my Eyes are better, after six weeks&rsquo; rest and 
Blue Glasses.&nbsp; But I say so with due regard to my old Friend
Nemesis.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing about my dear Donne since you wrote: and 
you only said that you had not <i>heard</i> a good account of 
him.&nbsp; Since then you have, I doubt not, seen as well as 
heard.&nbsp; But, now that I see better (Absit Invidia!) I will 
ask Mowbray.</p>
<p>It is well, I think, that Carlyle desired to rest (as I am 
told he did) where he was born&mdash;at Ecclefechan, from which I
have, or had, several Letters dated by <!-- page 207--><a 
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>him.&nbsp; 
His Niece, who had not replied to my note of Enquiry, of two 
months ago, wrote to me after his Death.</p>
<p>Now I have written enough for you as well as for myself: and 
am yours always the same</p>

<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Feb.</i>, 1881.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>As you generally return a Salute so directly, I began to be 
alarmed at not hearing from you sooner&mdash;either that you were
ill, or your Daughter, or some ill news about Mr. Leigh.&nbsp; I 
had asked one who reads the Newspapers, and was told there had 
been much anxiety as to the Cunard Ship, which indeed was only 
just saved from total Wreck.&nbsp; But all is well so far as you 
and yours are concerned; and I will sing &lsquo;Gratias&rsquo; 
along with you.</p>
<p>Mowbray Donne wrote to tell me that he and his had provided 
for some man to accompany our dear old Friend in his walks; and, 
as he seems himself to like it, all is so far well in that 
quarter also.</p>
<p>I was touched with the account of Carlyle&rsquo;s simple 
Obsequies among his own Kinsfolk, in the place of <!-- page 
208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
208</span>his Birth&mdash;it was fine of him to settle that so it
should be.&nbsp; I am glad also that Mr. Froude is charged with 
his Biography: a Gentleman, as well as a Scholar and 
&lsquo;Writer of Books,&rsquo; who will know what to leave unsaid
as well as what to say.</p>
<p>Your account of &lsquo;The Cup&rsquo; is what I should have 
expected from you: and, if I may say so, from myself had I seen 
it.</p>
<p>And with this Letter comes my Sophocles, of which I have told 
you what I expect you will think also, and therefore need not 
say&mdash;unless of a different opinion.&nbsp; It came here I 
think the same Day on which I wrote to tell you it had not come: 
but I would not send it until assured that all was well with 
you.&nbsp; Such corrections as you will find are not meant as 
Poetical&mdash;or rather Versifying&mdash;improvements, but 
either to clear up obscurity, or to provide for some 
modifications of the two Plays when made, as it were, into 
one.&nbsp; Especially concerning the Age of &OElig;dipus: whom I 
do not intend to be the <i>old</i> man in Part II. as he appears 
in the original.&nbsp; For which, and some other things, I will, 
if Eyes hold, send you some printed reasons in an introductory 
Letter to Mr. Norton, at whose desire I finished what had been 
lying in my desk these dozen years.</p>
<p>As I said of my own &AElig;schylus Choruses, I say of old 
Potter&rsquo;s now: better just to take a hint from them of what 
they are about&mdash;or imagine it for yourself&mdash;and then 
imagine, or remember, some grand Organ piece&mdash;as of 
Bach&rsquo;s Preludes&mdash;which will be <!-- page 209--><a 
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>far better 
Interlude than Potter&mdash;or I&mdash;or even (as I dare think) 
than Sophocles&rsquo; self!</p>
<p>And so I remain your ancient Heretic,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Little

<p>The newly printed Part II. would not bear Ink.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Feb.</i>, 1881.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>Pray keep the Book: I always intended that you should do so if
you liked it: and, as I believe I said, I was sure that like it 
you would.&nbsp; I did not anticipate how much: but am all the 
more glad: and (were I twenty years younger) should be all the 
more proud; even making, as I do, a little allowance for your old
and constant regard to the Englisher.&nbsp; The Drama is, 
however, very skilfully put together, and very well versified, 
although that not as an original man&mdash;such as 
Dryden&mdash;would have versified it: I will, by and by, send you
a little introductory letter to Mr. Norton, explaining to him, a 
Greek Scholar, why I have departed from so much of the original: 
&lsquo;little&rsquo; I call the Letter, but yet so long that I 
did not wish him, or you, to have as much trouble in reading, as 
I, with my bad Eyes, had in writing it: so, as I tell 
him&mdash;and you&mdash;it must go to the Printers along with the
Play which it prates about.</p>
<p>I think I once knew why the two Cities in Egypt <!-- page 
210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
210</span>and B&oelig;otia were alike named Thebes; and perhaps 
could now find out from some Books now stowed away in a dark 
Closet which affrights my Eyes to think of.&nbsp; But any of your
learned friends in London will tell you, and probably more 
accurately than Paddy.&nbsp; I cannot doubt but that Sphinx and 
heaps more of the childish and dirty mythology of Greece came 
from Egypt, and who knows how far beyond, whether in Time or 
Space!</p>
<p>Your Uncle, the great John, did enact &OElig;dipus in some 
Tragedy, by whom I know not: I have a small Engraving of him in 
the Character, from a Drawing of that very clever artist De 
Wilde; <a name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210" 
class="citation">[210]</a> but this is a heavy Likeness, though 
it may have been a true one of J. K. in his latter years, or in 
one of his less inspired&mdash;or more 
asthmatic&mdash;moods.&nbsp; This portrait is one of a great many
(several of Mrs. Siddons) in a Book I have&mdash;and which I will
send you if you would care to see it: plenty of them are rubbish 
such as you would wonder at a sensible man having ever taken the 
trouble to put together.&nbsp; But I inherit a long-rooted 
Affection for the Stage: almost as real a World to me as Jaques 
called it.&nbsp; Of yourself there is but a Newspaper Scrap or 
two: I think I must have cut out and given you what was better: 
but I never thought any one worth having except Sir 
Thomas&rsquo;, which I had from its very first Appearance, and 
keep in a large Book along with some others of a like size: Kean,
Mars, Talma, Duchesnois, etc., <!-- page 211--><a 
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>which 
latter I love, though I heard more of them than I saw.</p>
<p>Yesterday probably lighted you up once again in London, as it 
did us down here.&nbsp; &lsquo;Richard&rsquo; thought he began to
feel himself up to his Eyes again: but To-day all Winter again, 
though I think I see the Sun resolved on breaking through the 
Snow clouds.&nbsp; My little Aconites&mdash;which are sometimes 
called &lsquo;New Year Gifts,&rsquo; <a 
name="citation211a"></a><a href="#footnote211a" 
class="citation">[211a]</a> have almost lived their little Lives:
my Snowdrops look only too much in Season; but we will hope that 
all this Cold only retards a more active Spring.</p>
<p>I should not have sent you the Play till Night had I thought 
you would sit up that same night to read it.&nbsp; Indeed, I had 
put it away for the Night Post: but my old Hermes came in to say 
he was going into Town to market, and so he took it with him to 
Post.</p>
<p>Farewell for the present&mdash;till next Full Moon?&nbsp; I am
really glad that all that Atlantic worry has blown over, and all 
ended well so far as you and yours are concerned.&nbsp; And I am 
always your ancient</p>

<p style="text-align: right">[<i>March</i>, 1881.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>It was very, very good and kind of you to write to me about 
Spedding.&nbsp; Yes: Aldis Wright had apprised <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>me of the 
matter just after it happened&mdash;he happening to be in London 
at the time; and but two days after the accident heard that 
Spedding was quite calm, and even cheerful; only anxious that 
Wright himself should not be kept waiting for some communication 
which S. had promised him!&nbsp; Whether to live, or to die, he 
will be Socrates still.</p>
<p>Directly that I heard from Wright, I wrote to Mowbray Donne to
send me just a Post Card&mdash;daily if he or his wife 
could&mdash;with but one or two words on 
it&mdash;&lsquo;Better,&rsquo; &lsquo;Less well,&rsquo; or 
whatever it might be.&nbsp; This morning I hear that all is going
on even better than could be expected, according to Miss 
Spedding.&nbsp; But I suppose the Crisis, which you tell me of, 
is not yet come; and I have always a terror of that French 
Adage&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Monsieur se porte mal</i>&mdash;<i>Monsieur
se porte mieux</i>&mdash;<i>Monsieur est</i>&rsquo;&mdash;Ah, you
know&mdash;or you guess, the rest.</p>
<p>My dear old Spedding, though I have not seen him these twenty 
years and more&mdash;and probably should never see him 
again&mdash;but he lives&mdash;his old Self&mdash;in my heart of 
hearts; and all I hear of him does but embellish the recollection
of him&mdash;if it could be embellished&mdash;for he is but the 
same that he was from a Boy&mdash;all that is best in Heart and 
Head&mdash;a man that would be incredible had one not known 
him.</p>
<p>I certainly should have gone up to London&mdash;even with Eyes
that will scarce face the lamps of Woodbridge&mdash;not to see 
him, but to hear the first intelligence <!-- page 213--><a 
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>I could 
about him.&nbsp; But I rely on the Postcard for but a 
Night&rsquo;s delay.&nbsp; Laurence, Mowbray tells me, had been 
to see him, and found him as calm as had been reported by 
Wright.&nbsp; But the Doctors had said that he should be kept as 
quiet as possible.</p>
<p>I think, from what Mowbray also says, that you may have seen 
our other old Friend Donne in somewhat worse plight than usual 
because of his being much shocked at this Accident.&nbsp; He 
would feel it indeed!&mdash;as you do.</p>
<p>I had even thought of writing to tell you of all this, but 
could not but suppose that you were more likely to know of it 
than myself; though sometimes one is greatly mistaken with those 
&lsquo;of course you knows, etc.&rsquo;&mdash;But you have known 
it all: and have very kindly written of it to me, whom you might 
also have supposed already informed of it: but you took the 
trouble to write, not relying on &lsquo;of course you know, 
etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have thought lately that I ought to make some enquiry about 
Arthur Malkin, who was always very kind to me.&nbsp; I had meant 
to send him my Crabbe, who was a great favourite of his 
Father&rsquo;s, &lsquo;an excellent companion for Old Age&rsquo; 
he told&mdash;Donne, I think.&nbsp; But I do not know if I ever 
did send him the Book, and now, judging by what you tell me, it 
is too late to do so, unless for Compliment.</p>
<p>The Sun, I see, has put my Fire out&mdash;for which I only 
thank him, and will go to look for him himself in my 
Garden&mdash;only with a Green Shade over my <!-- page 214--><a 
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Eyes.&nbsp;
I must get to London to see you before you move away to 
Leamington; when I can bear Sun or Lamp without odious blue 
Glasses, etc.&nbsp; I dare to think those Eyes are better, though
not Sun-proof: and I am ever yours</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>I have let the Full Moon pass because I thought you had 
written to me so lately, and so kindly, about our lost Spedding, 
that I would not call on you too soon again.&nbsp; Of him I will 
say nothing except that his Death has made me recall very many 
passages in his Life in which I was partly concerned.&nbsp; In 
particular, staying at his Cumberland Home along with Tennyson in
the May of 1835.&nbsp; &lsquo;Voil&agrave; bien long temps de 
&ccedil;a!&rsquo;&nbsp; His Father and Mother were both 
alive&mdash;he, a wise man, who mounted his Cob after Breakfast, 
and was at his Farm till Dinner at two&mdash;then away again till
Tea: after which he sat reading by a shaded lamp: saying very 
little, but always courteous, and quite content with any company 
his Son might bring to the house so long as they let him go his 
way: which indeed he would have gone whether they let him or 
no.&nbsp; But he had seen enough of Poets not to like them or 
their <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>Trade: Shelley, for a time living 
among the Lakes: Coleridge at Southey&rsquo;s (whom perhaps he 
had a respect for&mdash;Southey, I mean), and Wordsworth, whom I 
do not think he valued.&nbsp; He was rather jealous of 
&lsquo;Jem,&rsquo; who might have done available service in the 
world, he thought, giving himself up to such Dreamers; and 
sitting up with Tennyson conning over the Morte d&rsquo;Arthur, 
Lord of Burleigh, and other things which helped to make up the 
two Volumes of 1842.&nbsp; So I always associate that Arthur 
Idyll with Basanthwaite Lake, under Skiddaw.&nbsp; Mrs. Spedding 
was a sensible, motherly Lady, with whom I used to play Chess of 
a Night.&nbsp; And there was an old Friend of hers, Mrs. Bristow,
who always reminded me of Miss La Creevy, if you know of such a 
Person in Nickleby.</p>
<p>At the end of May we went to lodge for a week at 
Windermere&mdash;where Wordsworth&rsquo;s new volume of Yarrow 
Revisited reached us.&nbsp; W. was then at his home: but Tennyson
would not go to visit him: and of course I did not: nor even saw 
him.</p>
<p>You have, I suppose, the Carlyle Reminiscences: of which I 
will say nothing except that, much as we outsiders gain by them, 
I think that, on the whole, they had better have been kept 
unpublished&mdash;for some while at least.&nbsp; As also thinks 
Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece, who is surprised that Mr. Froude, whom her
Uncle trusted above all men for the gift of Reticence, should 
have been in so much hurry to publish what was left to his 
Judgment to publish or no.&nbsp; But Carlyle himself, <!-- page 
216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>I 
think, should have stipulated for Delay, or retrenchment, if 
publisht at all.</p>
<p>Here is a dull and coldish Day after the fine ones we have 
had&mdash;which kept me out of doors as long as they 
lasted.&nbsp; Now one turns to the Fireside again.&nbsp; 
To-morrow is Equinox Day; when, if the Wind should return to 
North East, North East will it blow till June 21, as we all 
believe down here.&nbsp; My Eyes are better, I presume to say: 
but not what they were even before Christmas.&nbsp; Pray let me 
hear how you are, and believe me ever the same</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F.G.</p>
<p>Oh! I doubted about sending you what I yet will send, as you 
already have what it refers to.&nbsp; It really calls for no 
comment from any one who does not know the Greek; those who do 
would probably repudiate it.</p>

Superstitions about him here; no less than that he always kills 
his Parents if he can: my young Reader is quite determined on 
this head: and there lately has been a Paper in some Magazine to 
the same effect.</p>
<p>My dear old Spedding sent me back to old Wordsworth too, who 
sings (his best songs, I think) about the Mountains and Lakes 
they were both associated with: and with a quiet feeling he 
sings, that somehow comes home to me more now than ever it did 
before.</p>
<p>As to Carlyle&mdash;I thought on my first reading that he must
have been &lsquo;<i>&eacute;gar&eacute;</i>&rsquo; at the time of
writing: a <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>condition which I well remember 
saying to Spedding long ago that one of his temperament might 
likely fall into.&nbsp; And now I see that Mrs. Oliphant hints at
something of the sort.&nbsp; Hers I think an admirable Paper: <a 
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218" 
class="citation">[218]</a> better than has yet been written, or 
(I believe) is likely to be written by any one else.&nbsp; 
Merivale, who wrote me that he had seen you, had also seen Mrs. 
Procter, who was vowing vengeance, and threatening to publish 
letters from Carlyle to Basil Montagu full of &lsquo;fulsome 
flattery&rsquo;&mdash;which I do not believe, and should not, I 
am sorry to say, unless I saw it in the original.&nbsp; I forget 
now what T. C. says of him: (I have lent the Book out)&mdash;but 
certainly Barry Cornwall told Thackeray he was &lsquo;a 
humbug&rsquo;&mdash;which I think was no uncommon opinion: I do 
not mean dishonest: but of pretension to Learning and Wisdom far 
beyond the reality.&nbsp; I must think Carlyle&rsquo;s judgments 
mostly, or mainly, true; but that he must have &lsquo;lost his 
head,&rsquo; if not when he recorded them, yet when he left them 
in any one&rsquo;s hands to decide on their publication.&nbsp; 
Especially when not about Public Men, but about their 
Families.&nbsp; It is slaying the Innocent with the Guilty.&nbsp;
But of all this you have doubtless heard in London more than 
enough.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pauvre et triste 
humanit&eacute;!&rsquo;&nbsp; One&rsquo;s heart opens again to 
him at the last: sitting alone in the middle of her 
Room&mdash;&lsquo;I want to die&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I 
want&mdash;a Mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, Mamma 
Letizia!&rsquo; Napoleon is said to have murmured as he 
lay.&nbsp; By way of pendant to <!-- page 219--><a 
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>this, 
recurs to me the Story that when Ducis was wretched his mother 
would lay his head on her Bosom&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, mon homme, mon 
pauvre homme!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well&mdash;I am expecting Aldis Wright here at Easter: and a 
young London Clerk (this latter I did invite for his short 
holiday, poor Fellow!).&nbsp; Wright is to read me &lsquo;The Two
Noble Kinsmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now I have written more than enough for yourself and me: 
whose Eyes may be the worse for it to-morrow.&nbsp; I still go 
about in Blue Glasses, and flinch from Lamp and Candle.&nbsp; 
Pray let me know about your own Eyes, and your own Self; and 
believe me always sincerely yours</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Littlegrange</span>.</p>
<p>I really was relieved that you did not write to thank me for 
the poor flowers which I sent you.&nbsp; They were so poor that I
thought you would feel bound so to do, and, when they were gone, 
repented.&nbsp; I have now some gay Hyacinths up, which make my 
pattypan Beds like China Dishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>:</p>
<p>This present Letter calls for no answer&mdash;except just that
which perhaps you cannot make it.&nbsp; If <!-- page 220--><a 
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>you have 
that copy of Plays revised by John the Great which I sent, or 
brought, you, I wish you would cause your Maid to pack it in 
brown Paper, and send it by Rail duly directed to me.&nbsp; I 
have a wish to show it to Aldis Wright, who takes an Interest in 
your Family, as in your Prophet.&nbsp; If you have already 
dismissed the Book elsewhere&mdash;not much liking, I think, the 
stuff which J. K. spent so much trouble on, I shall not be 
surprised, nor at all aggrieved: and there is not much for A. W. 
to profit by unless in seeing what pains your noble Uncle took 
with his Calling.</p>
<p>It has been what we call down here &lsquo;smurring&rsquo; 
rather than raining, all day long: and I think that Flower and 
Herb already show their gratitude.&nbsp; My Blackbird (I think it
is the same I have tried to keep alive during the Winter) seems 
also to have &lsquo;wetted his Whistle,&rsquo; and what they call
the &lsquo;Cuckoo&rsquo;s mate,&rsquo; with a rather harsh 
scissor note, announces that his Partner may be on the wing to 
these Latitudes.&nbsp; You will hear of him at Mr. W. 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, it may be.&nbsp; There must be Violets, 
white and blue, somewhere about where he lies, I think.&nbsp; 
They are generally found in a Churchyard, where also (the Hunters
used to say) a Hare: for the same reason of comparative security,
I suppose.</p>
<p>I am very glad you agree with me about Mrs. Oliphant.&nbsp; 
That one paper of hers makes me wish to read her Books.</p>
<p>You must somehow, or somewhile, let me know <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>your 
Address in Leamington, unless a Letter addressed to Cavendish 
Square will find you there.&nbsp; Always and truly yours</p>

<p>You will not break your Law, though you have done so 
once&mdash;to tell me of Spedding&mdash;But now you will 
not&mdash;nor let me know your Address&mdash;so I must direct to 
you at a venture: to Marshall Thompson&rsquo;s, whither I suppose
you will return awhile, even if you be not already there.&nbsp; I
think, however, that you are not there yet.&nbsp; If still at 
Leamington, you look upon a sight which I used to like well; that
is, the blue Avon (as in this weather it will be) running through
buttercup meadows all the way to Warwick&mdash;unless those 
Meadows are all built over since I was there some forty years 
ago.</p>
<p>Aldis Wright stayed with me a whole week at Easter: and we did
very well.&nbsp; Much Shakespeare&mdash;especially concerning 
that curious Question about the Quarto and Folio Hamlets which 
people are now trying to solve by Action as well as by 
Discussion.&nbsp; Then we had The Two Noble Kinsmen&mdash;which 
Tennyson and other Judges were assured has much <!-- page 
222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>of
W. S. in it.&nbsp; Which parts I forget, or never heard: but it 
seemed to me that a great deal of the Play might be his, though 
not of his best: but Wright could find him nowhere.</p>
<p>Miss Crabbe sent me a Letter from Carlyle&rsquo;s Niece, cut 
out from some Newspaper, about her Uncle&rsquo;s MS. Memoir, and 
his written words concerning it.&nbsp; Even if Froude&rsquo;s 
explanation of the matter be correct, he ought to have still 
taken any hesitation on Carlyle&rsquo;s part as sufficient proof 
that the MS. were best left unpublisht: or, at any rate, great 
part of it.&nbsp; If you be in London, you will be wearied enough
with hearing about this.</p>
<p>I am got back to my&mdash;S&eacute;vign&eacute;!&mdash;who 
somehow returns to me in Spring: fresh as the Flowers.&nbsp; 
These latter have done but badly this Spring, cut off or withered
by the Cold: and now parched up by this blazing Sun and dry

you are: and ever believe me yours</p>

<p>If I did not write (as doubtless I ought) to acknowledge the 
Playbook, I really believe that I thought you would have felt 
bound to answer my acknowledgment!&nbsp; It came all right, thank
you: and <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>A. Wright looked it over: and it has
been lying ready to be returned to you whenever you should be 
returned to London.&nbsp; I assure you that I wish you to keep 
it, unless it be rather unacceptable than otherwise; I never 
thought you would endure the Plays themselves; only that you 
might be interested in your brave Uncle&rsquo;s patient and, I 
think, just, revision of them.&nbsp; This was all I cared for: 
and wished to show to A. W. as being interested in all that 
concerns so noble an Interpreter of his Shakespeare as your Uncle
was.&nbsp; If you do not care&mdash;or wish&mdash;to have the 
Book again, tell me of some one you would wish to have it: had I 
wished, I should have told you so at once: but I now give away 
even what I might have wished for to those who are in any way 
more likely to be more interested in them than myself, or are 
likely to have a few more years of life to make what they may of 
them.&nbsp; I do not think that A. W. is one of such: he thought 
(as you may do) of so much pains wasted on such sorry stuff.</p>
<p>So far from disagreeing with you about Shakespeare 
emendations, etc., I have always been of the same mind: quite 
content with what pleased myself, and, as to the elder 
Dramatists, always thinking they would be better all annihilated 
after some Selections made from them, as C. Lamb did.</p>
<p>Mowbray Donne wrote to me a fortnight or so since that his 
Father was &lsquo;pretty well,&rsquo; but weak in the 
knees.&nbsp; Three days ago came in Archdeacon Groome, who told 
me that a Friend of Mowbray&rsquo;s <!-- page 224--><a 
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>had just 
heard from him that his Father had symptoms of dropsy about the 
Feet and Ankles.&nbsp; I have not, however, written to ask; and, 
not having done so, perhaps ought not to sadden you with what may
be an inaccurate report.&nbsp; But one knows that, sooner or 
later, some such end must come; and that, in the meanwhile, 
Donne&rsquo;s Life is but little preferable to that which 
promises the speedier end to it.</p>
<p>We are all drying up here with hot Sun and cold Wind; my 
Water-pot won&rsquo;t keep Polyanthus and Anemone from 
perishing.&nbsp; I should have thought the nightly Frosts and 
Winds would have done for Fruit as well as Flower: but I am told 
it is not so as yet: and I hope for an honest mess of Gooseberry 
Fool yet.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, &lsquo;Ce sera le mois de Mai

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:</p>
<p>I must write you a word of &lsquo;God Speed&rsquo; before you 
go: before even you go to London to prepare for going: for, if I 
wait till then, you will be all bother with preparations, and 
leave-takings; and nevertheless feel yourself bound to 
answer.&nbsp; Pray <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>do not, even if (as I suppose) still
at Leamington; for you will still have plenty to think about with
Daughter and Children.&nbsp; I do not propose to go to London to 
shake hands before you go off: for, as I say, you will have 
enough of that without me&mdash;and my blue Spectacles, which I 
can only discard as yet when looking on the Grass and young 
Leaves.</p>
<p>I duly sent your Book to Henry Kemble, as you desired: and 
received a very polite Note from him in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>And now my house is being pulled about my Ears by preparations
for my Nieces next week.&nbsp; And, instead of my leaving the 
coast clear to Broom and Dust-pan, I believe that Charles Keene 
will be here from Friday to Monday.&nbsp; As he has long talked 
of coming, I do not like to put him off now he has really 
proposed to come, and we shall scramble on somehow.&nbsp; And I 
will get a Carriage and take him a long Drive into the Country 
where it is greenest.&nbsp; He is a very good fellow, and has 
lately lost his Mother, to whom he was a very pious Son; a man 
who can <i>reverence</i>, although a Droll in <i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>You will believe that I wish you all well among your 
Mountains.&nbsp; George Crabbe has been (for Health&rsquo;s sake)
in Italy these last two months, and wrote me his last Note from 
the Lago Maggiore.&nbsp; My Sister Jane Wilkinson talks of coming
over to England this Summer: but I think her courage will fail 
her when the time comes.&nbsp; If ever you should go to, or near,
Florence, she would be sincerely glad <!-- page 226--><a 
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>to see you,
and to talk over other Days.&nbsp; She is not at all obtrusively 
religious: and I think must have settled abroad to escape some of
the old Associations in which she took so much part, to but 
little advantage to herself or others.</p>
<p>You know that I cannot write to you when you are abroad unless
you tell me whither I am to direct.&nbsp; And you probably will 
not do that: but I do not, and shall [not] cease to be yours 
always and truly</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>:</p>
<p>I was not quite sure, from your letter, whether you had 
received mine directed to you in the Cavendish Square 
Hotel:&mdash;where your Nephew told me you were to be 
found.&nbsp; It is no matter otherwise than that I wish you to 
know that I had not only enquired if you were returned from 
abroad, but had written whither I was told you were to be 
found.&nbsp; Of which enough.</p>
<p>I am sorry you are gone again to Westminster, to which I 
cannot reconcile myself as to our old London.&nbsp; Even 
Bloomsbury recalls to me the pink May which used to be seen in 
those old Squares&mdash;sixty years ago.&nbsp; But &lsquo;enfin, 
voil&agrave; qui est fait.&rsquo;&nbsp; You know where that comes
from.&nbsp; I have not lately been in company with my old dear: 
Annie Thackeray&rsquo;s <!-- page 227--><a 
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Book <a 
name="citation227a"></a><a href="#footnote227a"

Rail carriage; but my old Girl is scarce half herself in 
it.&nbsp; And there are many inaccuracies, I think.&nbsp; Mais

<p>Athen&aelig;um and Academy advertise your Sequel to Records. 
<a name="citation227b"></a><a href="#footnote227b"

as I thought, have found a place in the Records.</p>
<p>Mowbray Donne wrote me a month ago that his Father was very 
feeble: one cannot expect but that he will continue to become 
more and more so.&nbsp; I should run up to London to see him, if 
I thought my doing so would be any real comfort to him: but 
<i>that</i> only his Family can be to him: and I think he may as 
little wish to exhibit his Decay to an old Friend, who so long 
knew him in a far other condition, as his friend might wish to 
see him so altered.&nbsp; This is what I judge from my own 
feelings.</p>
<p>I have only just got my Garden laid up for the winter, and 
planted some trees in lieu of those which that last gale blew 
down.&nbsp; I hear that Kensington Gardens suffered greatly: how 
was it with your Green Park, on which you now look down from such
a height, and, I suppose, through a London Fog?</p>

My own company are to be, Aldis Wright, with whom Shakespeare, 
etc., a London Clerk, may be&mdash;that is, if he can get 
sufficient Holyday&mdash;and one or two Guests for the Day.</p>

Tennyson, telling me of a Visit that he and his Father had been 
making to Warwickshire and Sherwood.&nbsp; The best news was that

<p>Why, what is become of your Sequel?&nbsp; I see no more 
advertisement of it in Athen&aelig;um and Academy&mdash;unless it
appears in the last, which I have not conned over.&nbsp; Somehow 
I think it not impossible&mdash;or even unlikely&mdash;that

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:</p>
<p>This week I was to have been in London&mdash;for the purpose 
of seeing&mdash;or offering to see&mdash;our dear Donne.&nbsp; 
For, when they told him of my offer, he said he should indeed 
like it much&mdash;&lsquo;if he were well enough.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Anyhow, I can but try, only making him previously understand that
he is not to make any effort in the case.&nbsp; He is, they tell 
me, pleased with any such mark of remembrance and regard from his
old Friends.&nbsp; And I should have offered to go before now, 
had I not judged from your last account of him that he was better
left with his Family, for his own sake, as well [as] for that of 
his Friends.&nbsp; However, as I said, I should have gone up on 
Trial even now, but that I have myself been, and am yet, 
suffering with some sort of Cold (I think, from some indications,
Bronchial) which would ill enable me to be of any use if I got to
London.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get warm, in spite of Fires, and 
closed doors, so must wait, at any rate, to see what another week
will do for me.</p>
<p>I shall, of course, make my way to Queen Anne&rsquo;s, where I
should expect to find you still busy with your Proof-sheets, 
which I am very glad to hear of as going on.&nbsp; What could 
have put it into my head even to think otherwise?&nbsp; Well, 
more unlikely things might <!-- page 231--><a 
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>have 
happened&mdash;even with Medes and Persians.&nbsp; I do not think
you will be offended at my vain surmises.</p>
<p>I see my poor little Aconites&mdash;&lsquo;New Year&rsquo;s 
Gifts&rsquo;&mdash;still surviving in the Garden-plot before my 
window; &lsquo;still surviving,&rsquo; I say, because of their 
having been out for near a month agone.&nbsp; I believe that 
Messrs. Daffodil, Crocus and Snowdrop are putting in appearance 
above ground: but (old Coward) I have not put my own old Nose out
of doors to look for them.</p>
<p>I read (Eyes permitting) the Correspondence between Goethe and
Schiller (translated) from 1798 to 1806 <a 
name="citation231"></a><a href="#footnote231" 
class="citation">[231]</a>&mdash;extremely interesting to me, 
though I do not understand&mdash;and generally skip&mdash;the 
more purely &AElig;sthetic Part: which is the Part of Hamlet, I 
suppose.&nbsp; But, in other respects, two such men so freely 
discussing together their own, and each other&rsquo;s, works 
interest me greatly.&nbsp; At Night, we have The Fortunes of 
Nigel; a little of it&mdash;and not every night: for the reason 
that I do not wish to eat my Cake too soon.&nbsp; The last night 
but one I sent my Reader to see Macbeth played by a little 
&lsquo;Shakespearian&rsquo; company at a Lecture Hall here.&nbsp;
He brought me one new Reading&mdash;suggested, I doubt not, by 
himself, from a remembrance of Macbeth&rsquo;s tyrannical ways: 
&lsquo;Hang out our <i>Gallows</i> on the outward 
walls.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Boy took great Interest in 
the Play; and I like to encourage him in Shakespeare, rather than
in the Negro Melodists.</p>

me also the enclosed.</p>
<p>The writer of it&mdash;Mr. Sch&uuml;tz Wilson&mdash;a

believe&mdash;wrote up Omar Khayy&acirc;m some years ago, and, I 
dare say, somewhat hastened another (and so far as I am 
concerned) final Edition.&nbsp; Of his Mr. Terriss I did not know
even by name, till Mr. Wilson told me.&nbsp; So now you can judge
and act as you see fit in the matter.</p>
<p>If Terriss and Sch&uuml;tz W. fail in knowing your London

proposing to go so far as Cheltenham to ask advice of you.&nbsp; 
Our poor dear Donne would have been so glad, and so busy, in 
telling what he could in the matter&mdash;if only in hope of 
keeping up your Father&rsquo;s Tradition.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to advert to my own little ailments, while you, I
doubt not, are enduring worse.&nbsp; I should have gone to London

<p>&lsquo;It is so perfectly easy for any one in London to obtain
my Address, that I think I may leave the future Mercutio to do so
at his leisure or pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I dare say you are pretty much indifferent whether he ventures
or not; if he does, I can only hope that <!-- page 234--><a 
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>he is a 
Gentleman, and if he be so, I do not think you will be sorry to 
help him in trying to keep up your Father&rsquo;s traditionary 
excellence in the part, and to save Mr. Terriss&mdash;to save 
Mercutio&mdash;from the contagion of Mr. Irving&rsquo;s treatment
of Shakespeare&mdash;so far as I have seen of it&mdash;which is 
simply two acts of Hamlet.</p>
<p>As I told you, I know nothing&mdash;even hitherto heard 
nothing of Mr. Terriss.&nbsp; His friend, S. Wilson, I have never
seen neither.&nbsp; And I hope you will think I have done fairly 
well in my share of the Business.</p>
<p>Fanny Kerrich, my Niece, and a capital Woman, comes to me 
to-day, not more for the purpose of seeing myself, than my 
Brother&rsquo;s Widow who lives alone in a dismal place three 
miles off. <a name="citation234a"></a><a href="#footnote234a"

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>It is very kind of you to break through your rule of 
Correspondence, that you may tell me how it was with you that 
last Evening.&nbsp; I was aware of no &lsquo;stupidity&rsquo; 
<!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
235</span>on your side: I only saw that you were what you called 
&lsquo;a little tired, and unwell.&rsquo;&nbsp; Had I known how 
much, I should of course have left you with a farewell shake of 
hands at once.&nbsp; And in so far I must blame you.&nbsp; But I 
blame myself for rattling on, not only then, but always, I fear, 
in a manner that you tell me (and I thank you for telling me) 
runs into occasional impertinence&mdash;which no length of 
acquaintance can excuse, especially to a Lady.&nbsp; You will 
think that here is more than enough of this.&nbsp; But pray do 
you also say no more about it.&nbsp; I know that you regard me 
very kindly, as I am sure that I do you, all the while.</p>
<p>And now I have something to say upon something of a like 
account; about that Mr. Sch&uuml;tz Wilson, who solicited an 
Introduction to you for his Mercutio, and then proposed to you to
avail <i>himself</i> of it.&nbsp; That I thought he had better 
have waited for, rather than himself proposed; and I warned you 
that I had been told of his being somewhat of a 
&lsquo;prosateur&rsquo; at his Club.&nbsp; You, however, would 
not decline his visit, and would encourage him, or not, as you 
saw fit.</p>
<p>And now the man has heaped coals of fire on my head.&nbsp; Not
content with having formerly appraised that Omar in a way that, I
dare say, advanced him to another Edition: he (S.W.) now writes 
me that he feels moved to write in favour of another Persian who 
now accompanies Omar in his last Avatar!&nbsp; I have told him 
plainly that he had better not employ time and talent on what I 
do not think he will ever <!-- page 236--><a 
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>persuade 
the Public to care about&mdash;but he thinks he will. <a 
name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236" 
class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; He may very likely cool upon it:
but, in the meanwhile, such are his good Intentions, not only to 
the little Poem, but, I believe, to myself also&mdash;personally 
unknown as we are to one another.&nbsp; Therefore, my dear Lady, 
though I cannot retract what I told you on such authority as I 
had,&mdash;nevertheless, as you were so far prejudiced in his 
favour because of such service as he formerly was to me, I feel 
bound to tell you of this fresh offer on his part: so that, as 
you were not unwilling to receive him on trial before, you may 
not be less favourably disposed toward him now; in case he should
call&mdash;which I doubt not he will do; though be pleased to 
understand that I have no more encouraged him to do so now than 
at first I did.</p>
<p>What a long Story!&mdash;I still chirp a little in my throat; 
but go my ways abroad by Night as well as by Day: even sitting 
out, as only last night I did.&nbsp; The S.W. wind that is so 
mild, yet sweeps down my garden in a way that makes havoc of 
Crocus and Snowdrop; Messrs. Daffodil and Hyacinth stand up 
better against it.</p>
<p>I hear that Lord Houghton has been partly paralysed; but is up
again.&nbsp; Thompson, Master of Trinity, had a very slight 
attack of it some months ago; I was told Venables had been ill, 
but I know not of what, nor how much; and all these my 
contemporaries; and I, at any rate, still yours as ever</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>It is not yet full Moon: <a name="citation237a"></a><a 
href="#footnote237a" class="citation">[237a]</a>&mdash;but it is 
my 74th Birthday: and you are the only one whom I write to on 
that great occasion.&nbsp; A good Lady near here told me she 
meant to pay me a visit of congratulation: and I begged her to 
stay at home, and neither say, nor write, anything about 
it.&nbsp; I do not know that [I] have much to say to you now that
I am inspired; but it occurred to me that you might be going away
somewhere for Easter, and so I would try to get a word from you 
concerning yourself before you left London.</p>
<p><i>The Book</i>?&nbsp; &lsquo;Ready immediately&rsquo; 
advertised Bentley near a fortnight ago: to-morrow&rsquo;s 
Academy or Athen&aelig;um will perhaps be talking of it 
to-morrow: of all which you will not read a word, I 
&lsquo;guess.&rsquo;&nbsp; I think you will get out of London for
Easter, if but to get out of the way.&nbsp; Or are you too 
indifferent even for that?</p>
<p>Satiated as you may have been with notices and records of 
Carlyle, do, nevertheless, look at Wylie&rsquo;s Book <a 
name="citation237b"></a><a href="#footnote237b" 
class="citation">[237b]</a> about him: if only for a Scotch 
Schoolboy&rsquo;s <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>account of a Visit to him not long 
before he died, and also the words of his Bequest of 
Craigenputtock to some Collegiate Foundation.&nbsp; Wylie (of 
whom I did not read all, or half) is a Worshipper, but not a 
blind one.&nbsp; He says that Scotland is to be known as the 
&lsquo;Land of Carlyle&rsquo; from henceforward.&nbsp; One used 
to hear of the &lsquo;Land of Burns&rsquo;&mdash;then, I think, 
&lsquo;of Scott.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is already a flush of Green, not only on the hedges, but
on some of the trees; all things forwarder, I think, by six weeks
than last year.&nbsp; Here is a Day for entering on 
seventy-four!&nbsp; But I do think, notwithstanding, that I am 
not much the better for it.&nbsp; The Cold I had before 
Christmas, returns, or lurks about me: and I cannot resolve on my
usual out-of-door liberty.&nbsp; Enough of that.&nbsp; I suppose 
that I shall have some Company at Easter; my poor London Clerk, 
if he can find no more amusing place to go to for his short 
Holyday; probably Aldis Wright, who always comes into these parts
at these Seasons&mdash;his &lsquo;Nazione&rsquo; being 
Beccles.&nbsp; Perhaps also a learned Nephew of mine&mdash;John 
De Soyres&mdash;now Professor of some History at Queen&rsquo;s 
College, London, may look in.</p>
<p>Did my Patron, Mr. Sch&uuml;tz Wilson, ever call on you, up to
this time?&nbsp; I dare say, not; for he may suppose you still 
out of London.&nbsp; And, though I have had a little 
correspondence with him since, I have not said a word about your 
return&mdash;nor about yourself.&nbsp; I saw in my Athen&aelig;um
or Academy <!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>that Mercutio did as usual.&nbsp; 
Have you seen the Play?</p>
<p>I conclude (from not hearing otherwise from Mowbray) that his 
Father is much as when I saw him.&nbsp; I do not know if the 
Papers have reported anything more of Lord Houghton, and I have 
not heard of him from my few correspondents.</p>
<p>But pray do you tell me a word about Mrs. Kemble; and beg her 
to believe me ever the same</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F.G.</p>
<h2>CIII.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Spring</i>, 1882.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I scarce think, judging by my old Recorder the Moon, that it 
is a month since I last wrote to you.&nbsp; But not far off, 
neither.&nbsp; Be that as it may, just now I feel inclined to 
tell you that I lately heard from Hallam Tennyson by way of 
acknowledgment of the Programme of a Recital of his 
Father&rsquo;s verse at Ipswich, by a quondam Tailor there.&nbsp;
This, as you may imagine, I did for fun, such as it was.&nbsp; 
But Hallam replies, without much reference to the Reading: but to
tell me how his Father had a fit of Gout in his hand while he was
in London: and therefore it was that he had not called on you as 
he had intended.&nbsp; Think of my dear old Fellow with the <!-- 
page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
240</span>Gout!&nbsp; In consequence of which he was forbidden 
his daily allowance of Port (if I read Hallam&rsquo;s scrawl 
aright), which, therefore, the Old Boy had stuck to like a fine 
Fellow with a constancy which few modern Britons can boast 
of.&nbsp; This reminded me that when I was on my last visit to 
him, Isle of Wight, 1854, he stuck to his Port (I do not mean too
much) and asked me, who might be drinking Sherry, if I did not 
see that his was &lsquo;the best Beast of the two.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
So he has remained true to his old Will Waterproof 
Colours&mdash;and so he was prevented from calling on 
you&mdash;his hand, Hallam says, swelled up like &lsquo;a great 
Sponge.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ah, if he did not live on a somewhat large 
scale, with perpetual Visitors, I might go once more to see 
him.</p>
<p>Now, you will, I know, answer me (unless your hand be like 
his!) and then you will tell me how you are, and how your Party 
whom you were expecting at Leamington when last you wrote.&nbsp; 
I take for granted they arrived safe, in spite of the Wind that a
little alarmed you at the time of your writing.&nbsp; And now, in
another month, you will be starting to meet your American Family 
in Switzerland, if the Scheme you told me of still 
hold&mdash;with them, I mean.&nbsp; So, by the Moon&rsquo;s law, 
I shall write to you once again before you leave, and 
you&mdash;will once more answer!</p>
<p>I shall say thus much of myself, that I do not shake off the 
Cold and Cough that I have had, off and on, these four months: I 
certainly feel as if some of the internal timbers were shaken; 
which is not to be <!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span

be in Switzerland.&nbsp; And when once you get there, it is all 
over with full moons as far as my correspondence with you is 
concerned.</p>
<p>I heard from Mowbray that his Father had been all but lost to 
him: but had partially recovered.&nbsp; Not <!-- page 242--><a 
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>for long, I
suppose: nor need I hope: and this is all I will say to you on 
this subject.</p>
<p>I have now Charles Keene staying Whitsuntide with me, and was 
to have had Archdeacon Groome to meet him; but he is worn out 
with Archidiaconal Charges, and so cannot come.&nbsp; But C. K. 
and I have been out in Carriage to the Sea, and no visitor, nor 
host, could wish for finer weather.</p>
<p>But this of our dear Donne over-clouds me a little, as I doubt
not it does you.&nbsp; Mowbray was to have come down for three 
days just now to a Friend five miles off: but of course&mdash;you
know.</p>
<p>Somehow I am at a loss to write to you on such airy topics as 
usual.&nbsp; Therefore, I shall simply ask you to let me know, in
as few lines as you care to write, when you leave England: and to
believe me, wherever you go,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>You wrote me that you had bidden Blanche to let you know about
her Father: and this I conclude that she, or some of her family 
have done.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I will make assurance doubly sure 
by enclosing you the letters I received from Mowbray, according 
to their dates: and will send them&mdash;for once&mdash;through 
Coutts, in hopes that he may find you, as you will <!-- page 
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Death <a name="citation243a"></a><a href="#footnote243a" 
class="citation">[243a]</a> I say nothing: as you may expect of 
me, and as I should expect of you also; if I may say so.</p>
<p>I have been to pay my annual Visit to George Crabbe and his 
Sisters in Norfolk.&nbsp; And here is warm weather come to us at 
last (as not unusual after the Longest Day), and I have almost 
parted with my Bronchial Cold&mdash;though, as in the old Loving 
Device of the open Scissors, &lsquo;To meet again.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
can only wonder it is no worse with me, considering how my 
contemporaries have been afflicted.</p>
<p>I am now reading Froude&rsquo;s Carlyle, which seems to me 
well done.&nbsp; Insomuch, that I sent him all the Letters I had 
kept of Carlyle&rsquo;s, to use or not as he pleased, etc.&nbsp; 
I do not think they will be needed among the thousand others he 
has: especially as he tells me that his sole commission is, to 
edit Mrs. Carlyle&rsquo;s Letters, for which what he has already 
done is preparatory: and when this is completed, he will add a 
Volume of personal Recollections of C. himself.&nbsp; 
Froude&rsquo;s Letter to me is a curious one: a sort of 
vindication (it seems to me) of himself&mdash;quite uncalled for 
by me, who did not say one word on the subject. <a 
name="citation243b"></a><a href="#footnote243b" 
class="citation">[243b]</a>&nbsp; The job, he says, was forced 
<!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
244</span>upon him: &lsquo;a hard problem&rsquo;&mdash;No 
doubt&mdash;But he might have left the Reminiscences unpublisht, 
except what related to Mrs. C.&mdash;in spite of Carlyle&rsquo;s 
oral injunction which reversed his written.&nbsp; Enough of all 
this!</p>
<p>Why will you not &lsquo;initiate&rsquo; a letter when you are 
settled for a while among your Mountains?&nbsp; Oh, ye Medes and 
Persians!&nbsp; This may be impertinent of me: but I am ever

<p>I have let the Full Moon <a name="citation245b"></a><a 
href="#footnote245b" class="citation">[245b]</a> go by, and very 
well she looked, too&mdash;over the Sea by which I am now 
staying.&nbsp; Not at Lowestoft: but at the old extinguished 
Borough of Aldeburgh, to which&mdash;as to other &lsquo;premiers 
Amours,&rsquo; I revert&mdash;where more than sixty years ago I 
first saw, and first felt, the Sea&mdash;where I have lodged in 
half the houses since; and where I have a sort of traditional 
acquaintance with half the population.&nbsp; &lsquo;Clare 
Cottage&rsquo; is where I write from; two little 
rooms&mdash;enough for me&mdash;a poor civil Woman pleased to 
have me in them&mdash;oh, yes,&mdash;and a little spare Bedroom 
in which I stow a poor Clerk, with his Legs out of the window 
from his bed&mdash;like a Heron&rsquo;s from his nest&mdash;but 
rather more horizontally.&nbsp; We dash about in Boats whether 
Sail or Oar&mdash;to which latter I leave him for his own good 
Exercise.&nbsp; Poor fellow, he would have liked to tug at that, 
or rough-ride a horse, from Boyhood: but must be made Clerk in a 
London Lawyer&rsquo;s Office: and so I am glad to get him down 
for a Holyday when he can get one, poor Fellow!</p>
<p>The Carlyle &lsquo;Reminiscences&rsquo; had long indisposed me
from taking up the Biography.&nbsp; But when I began, and as I 
went on with that, I found it one of the most interesting of 
Books: and the result is that I not <!-- page 246--><a 
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>only admire
and respect Carlyle more than ever I did: but even love him, 
which I never thought of before.&nbsp; For he loved his Family, 
as well as for so long helped to maintain them out of very 
slender earnings of his own; and, so far as these two Volumes 
show me, he loved his Wife also, while he put her to the work 
which he had been used to see his own Mother and Sisters fulfil, 
and which was suitable to the way of Life which he had been used 
to.&nbsp; His indifference to her sufferings seems to me rather 
because of Blindness than Neglect; and I think his Biographer has
been even a little too hard upon him on the score of Selfish 
disregard of her.&nbsp; Indeed Mr. Norton wrote to me that he 
looked on Froude as something of an Iago toward his Hero in 
respect of all he has done for him.&nbsp; The publication of the 
Reminiscences is indeed a mystery to me: for I should [have] 
thought that, even in a mercantile point of view, it would 
indispose others, as me it did, to the Biography.&nbsp; But Iago 
must have bungled in his work so far as I, for one, am concerned,
if the result is such as I find it&mdash;or unless I am very 
obtuse indeed.&nbsp; So I tell Mr. Norton; who is about to edit 
Carlyle&rsquo;s Letters to Emerson, and whom I should not like to
see going to his work with such an &lsquo;Animus&rsquo; toward 
his Fellow-Editor.</p>

wrought on by him, post my letter&mdash;why, you will, by your 
Laws, be obliged to answer it.&nbsp; Perhaps you may have a 
little to tell me of yourself in requital for the very little you
have to hear of me.</p>
<p>I have made a new Acquaintance here.&nbsp; Professor Fawcett 
(Postmaster General, I am told) married a Daughter of one Newson 
Garrett of this Place, who is also Father of your Doctor 
Anderson.&nbsp; Well, the Professor (who was utterly blinded by 
the Discharge of his Father&rsquo;s Gun some twenty or 
twenty-five years ago) came to this Lodging to call on Aldis 
Wright; and, when Wright was gone, called on me, and also came 
and smoked a Pipe one night here.&nbsp; A thoroughly unaffected, 
unpretending, man; so modest indeed that I was ashamed afterwards
to think how <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>I had harangued him all the Evening,
instead of getting him to instruct me.&nbsp; But I would not ask 
him about his Parliamentary Shop: and I should not have 
understood his Political Economy: and I believe he was very glad 
to be talked to instead, about some of those he knew, and some 
whom I had known.&nbsp; And, as we were both in Crabbe&rsquo;s 
Borough, we talked of him: the Professor, who had never read a 
word, I believe, about him, or of him, was pleased to hear a 
little; and I advised him to buy the Life written by 
Crabbe&rsquo;s Son; and I would give him my Abstract of the Tales
of the Hall, by way of giving him a taste of the Poet&rsquo;s 
self.</p>
<p>Yes; you must read Froude&rsquo;s Carlyle above all things, 
and tell me if you do not feel as I do about it.&nbsp; Professor 
Norton persists <a name="citation248"></a><a href="#footnote248" 
class="citation">[248]</a> in it that I am proof against 
Froude&rsquo;s invidious insinuations simply because of my having
previously known Carlyle.&nbsp; But how is it that I did not know
that Carlyle was so good, grand, and even loveable, till I read 
the Letters, which Froude now edits?&nbsp; I regret that I did 
not know what the Book tells us while Carlyle was alive; that I 
might have loved him as well as admired him.&nbsp; But Carlyle 
never spoke of himself in that way: I never heard him advert to 
his Works and his Fame, except one day he happened to mention 
&lsquo;About the time when Men began to talk of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I do not know if I told you in my last that (as you foretold 
me would be the case) I did not find your <!-- page 249--><a

off of the recorder, but of the material.</p>

End of her.&nbsp; So it may do still: but for the last few days 
she has suffered less pain, and so we&mdash;hope.&nbsp; This has 
caused much trouble in my little household, as you may 
imagine&mdash;as well on our own account, as on hers.</p>
<p>Mowbray Donne wrote me that his Edith had been 
seriously&mdash;I know not if dangerously&mdash;ill; and he 
himself much out of sorts, having never yet (he says, and I 
believe) recovered from his Father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Blanche, 
for the present, is quartered at Friends&rsquo; and 
Kinsfolk&rsquo;s houses.</p>
<p>Aldis Wright has sent me a Photograph, copied from Mrs. 
Cameron&rsquo;s original, of James Spedding&mdash;so fine that I 
know not whether I feel more pleasure or pain in looking at 
it.&nbsp; When you return to England, you shall see it 
somehow.</p>
<p>I have had a letter or two from Annie Ritchie, who is busy 
writing various Articles for Magazines.&nbsp; One concerning Miss
Edgeworth in the Cornhill is pleasant reading. <a 
name="citation250b"></a><a href="#footnote250b" 
class="citation">[250b]</a>&nbsp; She tells me that Tennyson is 
at Aldworth (his Hampshire house, you know), and a notice in <!--
page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
251</span>Athen&aelig;um or Academy tells that he is about to 
produce &lsquo;a Pastoral Drama&rsquo; at one of the smaller 
Theatres! <a name="citation251a"></a><a href="#footnote251a" 
class="citation">[251a]</a></p>
<p>You may have seen&mdash;but more probably have not 
seen&mdash;how Mr. Irving and Co. have brought out &lsquo;Much 
Ado&rsquo; with all <i>&eacute;clat</i>.</p>
<p>It seems to me (but I believe it seems so every year) that our
trees keep their leaves very long; I suppose because of no severe
frosts or winds up to this time.&nbsp; And my garden still shows 
some Geranium, Salvia, Nasturtium, Great Convolvulus, and that 
grand African Marigold whose Colour is so comfortable to us 
Spanish-like Paddies. <a name="citation251b"></a><a 
href="#footnote251b" class="citation">[251b]</a>&nbsp; I have 
also a dear Oleander which even now has a score of blossoms on 
it, and touches the top of my little Greenhouse&mdash;having been
sent me when &lsquo;haut comme &ccedil;a,&rsquo; as Marquis 
Somebody used to say in the days of Louis XIV.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t 
you love the Oleander?&nbsp; So clean in its leaves and stem, as 
so beautiful in its flower; loving to stand in water, which it 
drinks up so fast.&nbsp; I rather worship mine.</p>
<p>Here is pretty matter to get Coutts to further on to 
Paris&mdash;to Mrs. Kemble in Paris.&nbsp; And I have written it 
all in my best MS. with a pen that has been held with its nib in 
water for more than a fortnight&mdash;Charles Keene&rsquo;s

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:</p>
<p>You must be homeward-bound by this time, I think: but I hope 
my letter won&rsquo;t light upon you just when you are leaving 
Paris, or just arriving in London&mdash;perhaps about to see Mrs.
Wister off to America from Liverpool!&nbsp; But you will know 
very well how to set my letter aside till some better 
opportunity.&nbsp; May Mrs. Wister fare well upon her Voyage over
the Atlantic, and find all well when she reaches her home.</p>
<p>I have been again&mdash;twice or thrice&mdash;to Aldeburgh, 
when my contemporary old Beauty Mary Lynn was staying there; and 
pleasant Evenings enough we had, talking of other days, and she 
reading to me some of her Mudie Books, finishing with a nice 
little Supper, and some hot grog (for me) which I carried back to
the fire, and <i>set on the carpet</i>. <a 
name="citation252b"></a><a href="#footnote252b" 
class="citation">[252b]</a>&nbsp; She read me (for one thing) 
&lsquo;Marjorie Fleming&rsquo; from a Volume of Dr. <!-- page 
253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
253</span>Brown&rsquo;s Papers <a name="citation253a"></a><a 
href="#footnote253a" class="citation">[253a]</a>&mdash;read it as
well as she could for laughing&mdash;&lsquo;idiotically,&rsquo; 
she said&mdash;but all the better to my mind.&nbsp; She had been 
very dismal all day, she said.&nbsp; Pray get some one to read 
you &lsquo;Marjorie&rsquo;&mdash;which I say, because (as I 
found) it agrees with one best in that way.&nbsp; If only for 
dear Sir Walter&rsquo;s sake, who doated on the Child; and would 
not let his Twelfth Night be celebrated till she came through the
Snow in a Sedan Chair, where (once in the warm Hall) he called 
all his Company down to see her nestling before he carried her 
upstairs in his arms.&nbsp; A very pretty picture.&nbsp; My old 
Mary said that Mr. Anstey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vice Versa&rsquo; made 
her and a friend, to whom she read it, laugh idiotically too: but
I could not laugh over it alone, very clever as it is.&nbsp; And 
here is enough of me and Mary.</p>
<p>Devrient&rsquo;s Theory of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets (which 
you wrote me of) I cannot pretend to judge of: what he said of 
the Englishwomen, to whom the Imogens, Desdemonas, etc., were 
acceptable, seems to me well said.&nbsp; I named it to Aldis 
Wright in a letter, but what he thinks on the 
subject&mdash;surely no otherwise than Mrs. Kemble&mdash;I have 
not yet heard.&nbsp; My dear old Alfred&rsquo;s Pastoral troubles
me a little&mdash;that he should have exposed himself to ridicule
in his later days.&nbsp; Yet I feel sure that his aim is a noble 
one; and there was a good notice in the Academy <a 
name="citation253b"></a><a href="#footnote253b" 
class="citation">[253b]</a> saying there was much that was fine 
in the Play&mdash;nay, that <!-- page 254--><a 
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>a whole 
good Play might yet be made of it by some better 
Playwright&rsquo;s practical Skill.</p>
<p>And here is the end of my paper, before I have said something 
else that I had to say.&nbsp; But you have enough for the present
from your ancient E. F.G.&mdash;who has been busy arranging some 
&lsquo;post mortem&rsquo; papers.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>: <i>March</i> 6, [1883.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>,</p>
<p>I have asked more than one person for tidings of you, for the 
last two months: and only yesterday heard from M. Donne that he 
had seen you at the Address to which I shall direct this 
letter.&nbsp; I wrote to you about mid-November, desiring Coutts 
to forward my letter: in which I said that if you were in no mood
to write during the time of Mrs. Wister&rsquo;s departure for 
America (which you had told me was to be November end) you were 
not to trouble yourself at all.&nbsp; Since which time I have 
really not known whether you had not gone off to America 
too.&nbsp; Anyhow, I thought better to wait till I had some token
of your &lsquo;whereabout,&rsquo; if nothing more.&nbsp; And now 
Mowbray tells me that much, and I will venture another Letter to 
you after so long an interval.&nbsp; You must always follow your 
own inclination as to answering me&mdash;not by any means make a 
&lsquo;Duty&rsquo; of it.</p>
<p><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>As usual I have nothing to say of myself but what you 
have heard from me for years.&nbsp; Only that my (now one year 
old) friend Bronchitis has thus far done but little more than to 
keep me aware that he has not quitted me, nor even thinks of so 
doing.&nbsp; Nay, this very day, when the Snow which held off all
winter is now coming down under stress of N.E. wind, I feel my 
friend stirring somewhat within.</p>
<p>Enough of that and of myself.&nbsp; Mowbray gives me a very 
good report of you&mdash;Absit Nemesis for my daring to write 
it!&mdash;And you have got back to something of our old London 
Quarters, which I always look to as better than the new.&nbsp; 
And do you go to even a Play, in the old Quarters also?&nbsp; 
Wright, who was with me at Christmas, was taken by Macmillan to 
see &lsquo;Much Ado,&rsquo; and found, all except Scenery, etc. 
(which was too good) so bad that he vowed he would never go to 
see Sh. &lsquo;at any of your Courts&rsquo; again.&nbsp; Irving 
without any Humour, Miss Terry with simply Animal Spirits, 
etc.&nbsp; However, Wright did intend once more to 
try&mdash;Comedy of Errors, at some theatre; but how he liked 
it&mdash;I may hear if he comes to me at Easter.</p>
<p>Now this is enough&mdash;is it not?&mdash;for a letter: but I 
am as always</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>: <i>April</i> 12, [1883.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:</p>
<p>I do not think you will be sorry that more than a Moon has 
waxed and waned since last I wrote to you.&nbsp; For you have 
seen long enough how little I had to tell, and that nevertheless 
you were bound to answer.&nbsp; But all such Apologies are stale:
you will believe, I hope, that I remain as I was in regard to 
you, as I shall believe that you are the same toward me.</p>
<p>Mowbray Donne has told me two months ago that he could not get
over the Remembrance of last May; and that, acting on Body as 
well as Mind, aged him, I suppose, as you saw.&nbsp; Mowbray is 
one of the most loyal men toward Kinsman and Friend.</p>
<p>Now for my own little Budget of News.&nbsp; I got through 
those Sunless East winds well enough: better than I am feeling 
now they both work together.&nbsp; I think the Wind will rule 
till Midsummer: &lsquo;Enfin tant qu&rsquo;il plaira &agrave; 
Dieu.&rsquo;&nbsp; Aldis Wright was with me for Easter, and we 
went on our usual way, together or apart.&nbsp; Professor Norton 
had sent me his Carlyle-Emerson Correspondence, which we conned 
over together, and liked well on either side.&nbsp; Carlyle 
should not have said (and still less Norton printed) that 
Tennyson was a &lsquo;gloomy&rsquo; Soul, nor Thackeray <!-- page
257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
257</span>&lsquo;of inordinate Appetite,&rsquo; neither of which 
sayings is true: nor written of Lord Houghton as a &lsquo;Robin 
Redbreast&rsquo; of a man.&nbsp; I shall wait very patiently till
Mudie sends me Jane Carlyle&mdash;where I am told there is a word
of not unkindly toleration of me; which, if one be named at all, 
one may be thankful for. <a name="citation257"></a><a 
href="#footnote257" class="citation">[257]</a></p>
<p>Here are two Questions to be submitted to Mrs. Kemble by 
Messrs. Aldis Wright and Littlegrange&mdash;viz., What she 
understands by&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; &lsquo;The Raven himself is hoarse,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; &lsquo;But this <i>eternal</i> Blazon must not 
be,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kemble (who <i>will</i> answer my letter) can tell me how
she fares in health and well-being; yes, and if she has seen, or 
heard, anything of Alfred Tennyson, who is generally to be heard 
of in London at this time of year.&nbsp; And pray let Mrs. Kemble
believe in the Writer of these poor lines as her ancient, and 
loyal, Subject</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F.G.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The raven himself is hoarse,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lady Macbeth compares the Messenger, hoarse
for lack of Breath, to a raven whose croaking was held to be 
prophetic of Disaster.&nbsp; This we think the natural 
interpretation of the words, though it is rejected by some 
Commentators.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Clark and Wright&rsquo;s Clarendon 
Press Shakespeare</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Eternal Blazon&rsquo; = revelation of 
Eternity.&nbsp; It may be, <!-- page 258--><a 
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>however, 
that Sh. uses &lsquo;eternal&rsquo; for &lsquo;infernal&rsquo; 
here, as in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> I. 2, 160: &lsquo;The 
eternal Devil&rsquo;; and <i>Othello</i> IV. 2, 130: &lsquo;Some 
eternal villain.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Blazon&rsquo; is an heraldic
term, meaning Description of armorial bearings, * hence used for 
description generally; as in <i>Much Ado</i> II. 1, 307.&nbsp; 
The verb &lsquo;blazon&rsquo; occurs in <i>Cymbeline</i> IV. 2, 
170.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus have I written out in my very best hand: as I will take 
care to do in future; for I think it very bad manners to puzzle 
anyone&mdash;and especially a Lady&mdash;with that which is a 
trouble to read; and I really had no idea that I have been so 
guilty of doing so to Mrs. Kemble.</p>
<p>Also I beg leave to say that nothing in Mowbray&rsquo;s letter
set me off writing again to Mrs. Kemble, except her Address, 
which I knew not till he gave it to me, and I remain her very 
humble obedient Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">The Laird of 
Littlegrange</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>of which I enclose a side view done by a Woodbridge Artisan 
for his own amusement.&nbsp; So that Mrs. Kemble may be made 
acquainted with the &lsquo;<i>habitat</i>&rsquo; of the 
Flower&mdash;which is about to make an Omelette for its Sunday 
Dinner.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The &lsquo;Raven&rsquo; is not he that reports the 
news to Miladi M., but &lsquo;one of my fellows Who almost dead 
for breath, etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Not, as E. F.G. had thought, the Bearings 
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>I conclude (from what you wrote me in your last letter) that 
you are at Leamington by this time; and I will venture to ask a 
word of you before you go off to Switzerland, and I shall have to
rely on Coutts &amp; Co. for further Correspondence between 
us.&nbsp; I am not sure of your present Address, even should you 
be at Leamington&mdash;not sure&mdash;but yet I think my letter 
will find you&mdash;and, if it do not&mdash;why, then you will be
saved the necessity of answering it.</p>
<p>I had written to Mowbray Donne to ask about himself and his 
Wife: and herewith I enclose his Answer&mdash;very sad, and very 
manly.&nbsp; You shall return it if you please; for I set some 
store by it.</p>
<p>Now I am reading&mdash;have almost finished&mdash;Jane 
Carlyle&rsquo;s Letters.&nbsp; I dare say you have already heard 
them more than enough discussed in London; and therefore I will 
only say that it is at any rate fine of old Carlyle to have laid 
himself so easily open to public Rebuke, though whether such 
Revelations are fit for Publicity is another question.&nbsp; At 
any rate, it seems to me that <i>half</i> her letters, and 
<i>all</i> his ejaculations of Remorse summed up in a Preface, 
would have done better.&nbsp; There is an Article by brave Mrs. 
Oliphant in this month&rsquo;s Contemporary Review <a 
name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259" 
class="citation">[259]</a> (or <!-- page 260--><a

well worth reading on the subject; with such a Challenge to 
Froude as might almost be actionable in Law.&nbsp; We must 
&lsquo;hear both sides,&rsquo; and wait for the Volume which [is]
to crown all his Labours in this Cause.</p>
<p>I think your Leamington Country is more in Leaf than ours 
&lsquo;down-East:&rsquo; which only just begins to &lsquo;stand 
in a mist of green.&rsquo; <a name="citation260"></a><a 
href="#footnote260" class="citation">[260]</a>&nbsp; By the by, I
lately heard from Hallam Tennyson that all his Party were well 
enough; not having been to London this Spring because 
Alfred&rsquo;s Doctor had warned him against London Fogs, which 
suppress Perspiration, and bring up Gout.&nbsp; Which is the best
piece of news in my Letter; and I am</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours always and a Day<br />
E. F.G.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I do not enclose Mowbray&rsquo;s letter, as I had

<p>Stupid me!&nbsp; And now, after a little hunt, I find poor 
Mowbray&rsquo;s Letter, which I had made sure of having sent 
you.&nbsp; But I should not now send it if I did not implore you 
not to write in case you <!-- page 261--><a 
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>thought fit
to return it; which indeed I did ask you to do; but now I would 
rather it remained with you, who will acknowledge all the true 
and brave in it as well as I&mdash;yes, it may be laid, if you 
please, even among those of your own which you tell me 
Mowbray&rsquo;s Father saved up for you.&nbsp; If you return it, 
let it be without a word of your own: and pray do not 
misunderstand me when I say that.&nbsp; You will hear of me (if 
Coutts be true) when you are among your Mountains again; and, if 
you do hear of me, I know you will&mdash;for you 
must&mdash;reply.</p>
<p>At last some feeling of Spring&mdash;a month before 
Midsummer.&nbsp; And next week I am expecting my grave Friend 
Charles Keene, of Punch, to come here for a week&mdash;bringing 
with him his Bagpipes, and an ancient Viol, and a Book of 
Strathspeys and Madrigals; and our Archdeacon will come to meet 
him, and to talk over ancient Music and Books: and we shall all 
three drive out past the green hedges, and heaths with their 
furze in blossom&mdash;and I wish&mdash;yes, I do&mdash;that you 
were of the Party.</p>
<p>I love all Southey, and all that he does; and love that 
Correspondence of his with Caroline Bowles.&nbsp; We (Boy and I) 
have been reading an account of Zetland, which makes me thirst 
for &lsquo;The Pirate&rsquo; again&mdash;tiresome, I 
know&mdash;more than half of it&mdash;but what a Vision it leaves

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Kemble</span>:</p>
<p>I feel minded to write you a word of Farewell before you start
off for Switzerland: but I do not think it will be very welcome 
to you if, as usual, you feel bound to answer it on the Eve of 
your Departure.&nbsp; Why not let me hear from you when you are 
settled for a few days somewhere among your Mountains?</p>
<p>I was lately obliged to run to London on a disagreeable 
errand: which, however, got itself over soon after midday; when I
got into a Cab to Chelsea, for the purpose of seeing 
Carlyle&rsquo;s Statue on the Embankment, and to take a last look
at his old House in Cheyne Row.&nbsp; The Statue very good, I 
thought, <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>though looking somewhat small for 
want of a good Background to set it off: but the old House!&nbsp;
Shut up&mdash;neglected&mdash;&lsquo;To Let&rsquo;&mdash;was sad 
enough to me.&nbsp; I got back to Woodbridge before night. <a 
name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263" 
class="citation">[263]</a></p>
<p>Since then I have had Charles Keene (who has not been well) 
staying with me here for ten days.&nbsp; He is a very good Guest,
inasmuch as he entertains himself with Books, and 
Birds&rsquo;-nests, and an ancient Viol which he has brought down
here: as also a Bagpipe (his favourite instrument), only leaving 
the &lsquo;Bag&rsquo; behind: he having to supply its functions 
from his own lungs.&nbsp; But he will leave me to-morrow or next 
day; and with June will come my two Nieces from Lowestoft: and 
then the Longest Day will come, and we shall begin declining 
toward Winter again, after so shortly escaping from it.</p>
<p>This very morning I receive The Diary of John Ward, Vicar of 
Stratford on Avon from 1648 to 1679&mdash;with some notices of W.
S. which you know all about.&nbsp; And I am as ever</p>

Pollock on November 17th, 1871, FitzGerald says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Game-dealer here telling me that he has
some very good Pheasants, I have told him to send you a 
Brace&mdash;to go in company with Braces to Carlyle, and Mrs. 
Kemble.&nbsp; This will, you may think, necessitate your writing 
a Reply of Thanks before your usual time of writing: but 
don&rsquo;t do that:&mdash;only write to me now in case the 
Pheasants don&rsquo;t reach you; I know you will thank me for 
them, whether they reach you or not; and so you can defer writing
so much till you happen next upon an idle moment which you may 
think as well devoted to me; you being the only man, except 
Donne, who cares to trouble himself with a gratuitous letter to 
one who really does not deserve it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Donne, you know, is pleased with Everybody, and with 
Everything that Anybody does for him.&nbsp; You must take his 
Praises of Woodbridge with this grain of Salt to season 
them.&nbsp; It may seem odd to you at first&mdash;but not perhaps
on reflection&mdash;that I feel more&mdash;nervous, I may 
say&mdash;at the prospect of meeting with an old Friend, after 
all these years, than of any indifferent Acquaintance.&nbsp; I 
feel it the less with Donne, for the reason aforesaid&mdash;why 
should I not feel it with you who have given so many tokens since
our last meeting that you are well willing to take me as I 
am?&nbsp; If one is, indeed, by Letter what one is in 
person.&mdash;I always tell Donne not to come out of his way 
here&mdash;he says he takes me in the course of a Visit to some 
East-Anglian kinsmen.&nbsp; Have you ever any such 
reason?&mdash;Well; if you have no better reason than that of 
really wishing to see me, for better or worse, in my home, 
come&mdash;some Spring or Summer day, when my Home at any rate is
pleasant.&nbsp; This all sounds mock-modesty; but it is not; as I
can&rsquo;t read Books, Plays, Pictures, etc. and don&rsquo;t see
People, I feel, when a Man comes, that I have all to ask and 
nothing to tell; and one doesn&rsquo;t like to make a Pump of a 
Friend.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On Oct 13th, 1879, FitzGerald wrote of a copy of Olivier (ed.

wrote to Sir Frederick Pollock:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the beginning of this year I submitted

Friends&mdash;I must think that you are an old Friend as well as 
a very kind and constant one; and so I don&rsquo;t like not to 
send you what I have sent others.&mdash;The Artist who took me, 
took (as he always does) three several Views of one&rsquo;s Face:
but the third View (looking full-faced) got blurred by my 
blinking at the Light: so only these two were reproduced&mdash;I 
shouldn&rsquo;t know that either was meant for [me]: nor, I 
think, would any one else, if not told: but the Truth-telling Sun
somehow did them; and as he acted so handsomely by me, I take 
courage to distribute them to those who have a regard for me, and
will naturally like to have so favourable a Version of 
one&rsquo;s Outward Aspect to remember one by.&nbsp; I should not
have sent them if they had been otherwise.&nbsp; The up-looking 
one I call &lsquo;The Statesman,&rsquo; quite ready to be called 
to the Helm of Affairs: the Down-looking one I call The 
Philosopher.&nbsp; Will you take which you like?&nbsp; And when 
next old Spedding comes your way, give him the other (he 
won&rsquo;t care which) with my Love.&nbsp; I only don&rsquo;t 
write to him because my doing so would impose on his Conscience 
an Answer&mdash;which would torment him for some little 
while.&nbsp; I do not love him the less: and believe all the 
while that he not the less regards me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again on May 5, he wrote: &ldquo;I think I shall have a word 
about M[acready] from Mrs. Kemble, with whom I have been 
corresponding a little since her return to England.&nbsp; She has
lately been staying with her Son in Law, Mr. Leigh (?), at 
Stoneleigh Vicarage, near Kenilworth.&nbsp; In the Autumn she 
says she will go to America, never to return to England.&nbsp; 
But I tell her she <i>will</i> return.&nbsp; She is to sit for 
her Photo at my express desire, and I have given her Instructions
<i>how</i> to sit, derived from my own successful 
Experience.&nbsp; One rule is to sit&mdash;in a dirty 
Shirt&mdash;(to avoid dangerous White) and another is, not to sit
on a Sunshiny Day: which we must leave to the Young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the by, I sent old Spedding my own lovely Photo 
(<i>the Statesman</i>) which he has acknowledged in 
Autograph.&nbsp; He tells me that he begins to &lsquo;smell

<p>They had taken possession of FitzGerald&rsquo;s memory in

speaking of the poet&rsquo;s son, who was Vicar of Bredfield, he 
says: &ldquo;It is now just twenty years since the Brave old Boy

<p>read &lsquo;better day&rsquo;&mdash;a certain Emendation, I 
think.&nbsp; I hope you take Spedding into your Counsel; he might
be induced to look over one Play at a time though he might shrink
from all in a Body; and I scarce ever heard him conning a page of
Shakespeare but he suggested something which was an 
improvement&mdash;on Shakespeare himself, if not on his 
Editors&mdash;though don&rsquo;t [tell] Spedding that I say so,

over, and the party of four had removed from the table to the 
chimney, my mother would throw herself, with a sigh, upon an old 
cotton-covered sofa, and near her was placed a little stand with 
a light.&nbsp; I sat down by the fire with Lucile; the servants 
removed the supper-things, and retired.&nbsp; My father then 
began to walk up and down, and never ceased until his 
bedtime.&nbsp; He wore a kind of white woollen gown, or rather 
cloak, such as I have never seen with anyone else.&nbsp; His 
head, partly bald, was covered with a large white cap, which 
stood bolt upright.&nbsp; When, in the course of his walk, he got
to a distance from the fire, the vast apartment was so 
ill-lighted by a single candle that he could be no longer seen, 
he could still be heard marching about in the dark, however, and 
presently returned slowly towards the light, and emerged by 
degrees from obscurity, looking like a spectre, with his white 
robe and cap, and his tall, thin figure.&rsquo;</p>

rotting slower or faster, the forests of all other Years and

are long since quite gone to inorganic mould; others are like the
aloe, growths that last a thousand or three thousand 
years.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ste. Beuve, in his &lsquo;Nouveaux

However, I send them all I have: pretty confident they will 
select the worst; of course, for my own part, I would rather have
any other than copies of what I have: but I should like the World
to acknowledge he could do something beside the ugly and 
ridiculous.&nbsp; Annie T. sent me the enclosed Specimen: very 
careless, but full of Character.&nbsp; I can see W. M. T. drawing
it as he was telling one about his Scotch Trip.&nbsp; That 
disputatious Scotchman in the second Row with Spectacles,

class="footnote">[92]</a>&nbsp; When I was preparing the first 
edition of FitzGerald&rsquo;s Letters I wrote to Mrs. Kemble for 
permission to quote the passage from her Gossip which is here 
referred to.&nbsp; She replied (11 Dec. 1883):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have no objection whatever to your 
quoting what I said of Edward Fitzgerald in the <i>Atlantic 
Monthly</i>, but I suppose you know that it was omitted from 
Bentley&rsquo;s publication of my book at Edward&rsquo;s <i>own 
desire</i>.&nbsp; He did not certainly knock me on the head with 
Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s sledge-hammer, but he did make me feel 
painfully that I had been guilty of the impertinence of 
praising.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not then avail myself of the permission so readily 
granted, but I venture to do so now, in the belief that the 
publicity from which his sensitive nature shrank during his 
lifetime may now without impropriety be given to what was written
in all sincerity by one of his oldest and most intimate 
friends.&nbsp; It was Mrs. Kemble who described him as &lsquo;an 
eccentric man of genius, who took more pains to avoid fame than 
others do to seek it,&rsquo; and this description is fully borne 
out by the account she gave of him in the offending passage which
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That Mrs. Fitzgerald is among the most 
vivid memories of my girlish days.&nbsp; She and her husband were
kind and intimate friends of my father and mother.&nbsp; He was a
most amiable and genial Irish gentleman, with considerable 
property in Ireland and Suffolk, and a fine house in Portland 
Place, and had married his cousin, a very handsome, clever, and 
eccentric woman.&nbsp; I remember she always wore a bracelet of 
his hair, on the massive clasp of which were engraved the words, 
&lsquo;<i>Stesso sangue</i>, <i>stessa sorte</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
also remember, as a feature of sundry dinners at their house, the
first gold dessert and table ornaments that I ever saw, the 
magnificence of which made a great impression upon me; though I 
also remember their being replaced, upon Mrs. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s 
wearying of them, by a set of ground glass and dead and burnished
silver, so exquisite that the splendid gold service was 
pronounced infinitely less tasteful and beautiful.&nbsp; One 
member of her family&mdash;her son Edward Fitzgerald&mdash;has 
remained my friend till this day.&nbsp; His parents and mine are 
dead.&nbsp; Of his brothers and sisters I retain no knowledge, 
but with him I still keep up an affectionate and to me most 
valuable and interesting correspondence.&nbsp; He was 
distinguished from the rest of his family, and indeed from most 
people, by the possession of very rare intellectual and artistic 
gifts.&nbsp; A poet, a painter, a musician, an admirable scholar 
and writer, if he had not shunned notoriety as sedulously as most
people seek it, he would have achieved a foremost place among the
eminent men of his day, and left a name second to that of very 
few of his contemporaries.&nbsp; His life was spent in literary 
leisure, or literary labours of love of singular excellence, 
which he never cared to publish beyond the circle of his intimate
friends: Euphranor, Polonius, collections of dialogues full of 
keen wisdom, fine observation, and profound thought; sterling 
philosophy written in the purest, simplest, and raciest English; 
noble translations, or rather free adaptations of 
Calderon&rsquo;s two finest dramas, The Wonderful Magician and 
Life&rsquo;s a Dream, and a splendid paraphrase of the Agamemnon 
of &AElig;schylus, which fills its reader with regret that he 
should not have <i>Englished</i> the whole of the great trilogy 
with the same severe sublimity.&nbsp; In America this gentleman 
is better known by his translation or adaptation (how much more 
of it is his own than the author&rsquo;s I should like to know if
I were Irish) of Omar Khayy&aacute;m, the astronomer-poet of 
Persia.&nbsp; Archbishop Trench, in his volume on the life and 
genius of Calderon, frequently refers to Mr. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s 
translations, and himself gives a version of Life&rsquo;s a 
Dream, the excellence of which falls short, however, of his 
friend&rsquo;s finer dramatic poem bearing the same name, though 
he has gallantly attacked the difficulty of rendering the Spanish
in English verse.&nbsp; While these were Edward 
Fitzgerald&rsquo;s studies and pursuits, he led a curious life of
almost entire estrangement from society, preferring the 
companionship of the rough sailors and fishermen of the Suffolk 
coast to that of lettered folk.&nbsp; He lived with them in the 
most friendly intimacy, helping them in their sea ventures, and 
cruising about with one, an especially fine sample of his sort, 
in a small fishing-smack which Edward Fitzgerald&rsquo;s bounty 
had set afloat, and in which the translator of Calderon and 
&AElig;schylus passed his time, better pleased with the 
fellowship and intercourse of the captain and crew of his small 
fishing craft than with that of more educated and sophisticated 
humanity.&nbsp; He and his brothers were school-fellows of my 
eldest brother under Dr. Malkin, the master of the grammar school
of Bury St. Edmunds.&rdquo;</p>

mother, which his mother&mdash;her intimate friend&mdash;had kept
till her death, and which had been painted for Mrs. 
Fitzgerald.&nbsp; It is a full-length figure, very beautifully 
painted, and very like my mother.&nbsp; Almost immediately after 
receiving this from England, my friend Mr. Horace Furness came 
out to see me.&nbsp; He is a great collector of books and prints,
and brought me an old engraving of my mother in the character of 
Urania, which a great many years ago I remember to have seen, and
which was undoubtedly the original of Mrs. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s 
miniature.&nbsp; I thought the concidence of their both reaching

not wish even old English Friends to take me except on their way 
elsewhere: and for an American Gentleman!&nbsp; It is not 
affectation to say that any such proposal worried me.&nbsp; So 
what must I do but ask him to be sure to see Messrs. Wright and 
Cowell when he got to Cambridge: and spend part of one of his 
days there in going to Bury, and (even if he cared not for the 
Abbey with its Abbot Samson and Jocelyn) to sit with a Bottle of 
light wine at the Angel window, face to face with that lovely 
Abbey gate.&nbsp; Perhaps Cowell, I said, might go over with 
him&mdash;knowing and loving Gothic&mdash;that was a liberty for 
me to take with Cowell, but he need not go&mdash;I did not hint 
at you.&nbsp; I suppose I muddled it all.&nbsp; But do show the

disrespect which you and Cowell told me of in April.&rsquo;</p>

class="smcap">Onslow Gardens</span>, S.W.<br />
&lsquo;<i>May</i> 19.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear mr. FitzGerald</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly you are no stranger to me.&nbsp; I have heard
so often from Carlyle, and I have read so much in his letters, 
about your exertions, and about your entertainment of him at 
various times, that I can hardly persuade myself that I never saw
you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The letters you speak of must be very interesting, and 
I would ask you to let me see them if I thought that they were 
likely to be of use to me; but the subject with which I have to 
deal is so vast that I am obliged to limit myself, and so 
intricate that I am glad to be able to limit myself.&nbsp; I 
shall do what Carlyle desired me to do, <i>i.e.</i> edit the 
collection of his wife&rsquo;s letters, which he himself prepared
for publication.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This gift or bequest of his governs the rest of my 
work.&nbsp; What I have already done is an introduction to these 
letters.&nbsp; When they are published I shall add a volume of 
personal recollections of his later life; and this will be 
all.&nbsp; Had I been left unencumbered by special directions I 
should have been tempted to leave his domestic history untouched 
except on the outside, and have attempted to make a complete 
biography out of the general materials.&nbsp; This I am unable to
do, and all that I can give the world will be materials for some 
other person to use hereafter.&nbsp; I can explain no further the
conditions of the problem.&nbsp; But for my own share of it I 
have materials in abundance, and I must avoid being tempted off 
into other matters however important in themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may add for myself that I did not seek this duty, nor
was it welcome to me.&nbsp; C. asked me to undertake it.&nbsp; 
When I looked through the papers I saw how difficult, how, in 
some aspects of it, painful, the task would be.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Believe me,<br />
&lsquo;faithfully yours,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
